# Wrangler for Cloudflare R2

This folder contains files defining a [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) worker to manage a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

You need Cloudflare access to manage it.

You will first need to `npm install -g wrangler && wrangler login`.

To redeploy the wrangler, in the `blockprotocol` or `blockprotocol-preview` folder run `wrangler publish`.
