# License Guide

The license for a particular work is defined with following prioritized rules:

1.  License information directly present in the file
1.  `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file in the same directory as the work
1.  First `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file found when exploring parent directories up to the project top level directory
1.  Defaults to dual-release under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-APACHE.md) and [MIT License](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-MIT.md)

## Quick-reference

The vast majority of this repository is dual-licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-APACHE.md) and [MIT License](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-MIT.md).

The two limited exceptions to this are:

- The Block Protocol WordPress plugin ([more information](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress)), which is made available under the [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/.github/licenses/LICENSE-ELASTIC.md)
- A small number of vector icons used on the public-facing BlockProtocol.org website ([view site](https://blockprotocol.org/)), licensed to us directly
