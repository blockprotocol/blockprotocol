# WARNING

This package is not yet updated to Block Protocol version 0.2.

## React Block Loader

A component which loads a [Block Protocol](https://blockprotocol.org) block from a remote URL, and passes on the properties and functions you provide.

## Usage

`yarn install "react-block-loader"`

Pass RemoteBlock (at a minimum) a source url (`sourceUrl`), the properties the block expects (`blockProperties`),
and functions for it to call (`blockProtocolFunctions`), as set out in [the specification](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec).

```jsx
import { RemoteBlock } from "react-block-loader";

const blockDependencies = {
  react: require("react"),
  "react-dom": require("react-dom"),
};

const BlockLoader = ({ blockSourceFolder: string }) => {
  const [blockMetadata, setBlockMetadata] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`${blockSourceFolder}/block-metadata.json`)
      .then((resp) => resp.json())
      .then(setBlockMetadata);
  }, [componentId]);

  if (!blockMetadata) {
    return <div>Loading block metadata...</div>;
  }

  const blockProperties = {
    // block's own properties, entityId, linkedEntities, linkGroups, etc
  };

  const blockProtocolFunctions = {
    updateEntities: (actions) => {
      // persist block updates wherever you store them
    },
    // more Block Protocol Functions
  };

  return (
    <RemoteBlock
      blockMetadata={blockMetadata}
      blockProperties={blockProperties}
      blockProtocolFunctions={blockProtocolFunctions}
      externalDependencies={blockDependencies}
      LoadingIndicator={<h1>Optional custom loading indicator</h1>}
      onBlockLoaded={() =>
        console.log(`Block with componentId ${componentId} loaded.`)
      }
      sourceUrl={`${blockSourceFolder}/${blockMetadata.source}`}
    />
  );
};
```

## External dependencies

A block may indicate `externals` in `block-metadata.json` ([docs](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/core#defining-blocks)).

These are libraries the blocks expects the embedding application to supply it.
For example, a block may rely on React, but assume that the embedding application will provide it, to save loading it multiple times on a page.

In order to provide blocks with these dependencies, pass an object where the key is `<package-name>`,
and the value is `require(<package-name>)`, e.g.

```javascript
const blockDependencies = {
  react: require("react"),
  "react-dom": require("react-dom"),
};
```

## Security

This component automatically fetches, parses, and renders the component from the file at the provided `sourceUrl`.

You should either make sure you trust the source, or sandbox the component so that it does not matter if it is malicious.

## Source Fetching & Caching

Requests are cached by URL, so that each source URL only has to be fetched once, and parsed once (in the same window).

### Inside iFrames

Where each `RemoteBlock` instance is loaded in its own iFrame, you can optionally pass `crossFrame=true`,
and the block will send a message to the parent window requesting the text of the source file.
This allows the parent window to keep a cache of text per `sourceUrl`, which is useful if you have multiple
iFrames each loading the same remote block. Each iFrame will still have to parse the source.

See the following exports:

- `TextFromUrlRequestMessage` – a type for the message request shape
- `TextFromUrlResponseMessage` – a type for the response
- `isTextFromUrlRequestMessage` – a typeguard for checking the request is of the type of interest

```typescript
// in the parent window, listen for messages requesting text is fetched from a url
window.addEventListener("message", (requestMessage) => {
  if (isTextFromUrlRequestMessage(requestMessage)) {
    // Ideally you would have a Ref to the iFrame in which the component loads,
    // so that requests to fetch text from other iFrames are not processed.
    // this function otherwise will fetch any URL requested of it for any iFrame sending the correct message,
    // and will act with the origin of this window (potentially e.g. sending cookies when fetching the URL)
    if (source !== frameRef.current?.contentWindow) {
      return;
    }

    const { payload, requestId } = requestMessage.data;

    // implement memoizedFetch to cache the text by URL, to avoid fetching it for multiple blocks
    memoizedFetch(payload.url)
      .then((resp) => resp.text())
      .then((text) => {
        const responseMessage: TextFromUrlResponseMessage = {
          payload: { data: text },
          requestId,
        };
        requestMessage.source.postMessage(responseMessage, origin);
      });
  }
});
```

## Blocks supported

The component will parse and render blocks which are defined as:

- React components (i.e. a JavaScript file which exports a React component)
- Web Components (i.e. a JavaScript file which exports a custom element class)
- HTML (i.e. an HTML file, which may in turn load other assets)

For JavaScript files, the exported component must be one of:

1.  the default export from the file
1.  the only named export in the file
1.  an export named `App`
