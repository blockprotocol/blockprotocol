# DEPRECATED

With the introduction of Block Protocol v0.2, this package is no longer in use.

The Block Protocol is now composed of a `core` specification, and multiple **service** specifications.

Each specification is implemented in separate packages.

For types, please see:

- `@blockprotocol/graph` for all types related to entities, entity types, and links.
  Note that the `BlockProtocol` prefix has been removed.

- `@blockprotocol/core` for types related to block metadata.

See [https://blockprotocol.org/docs](https://blockprotocol.org/docs) for a fuller explanation of the Block Protocol.
