/**
 * This is an embedding application for local development and debugging.
 * It is the application loaded into the browser when you run 'yarn dev' (or 'npm run dev')
 * No data from it will be published with your block or included as part of a production build.
 *
 * The component used here, 'MockBlockDock', does the following:
 * 1. It renders your block on the page and provides the initial properties specified below
 * 2. It holds an in-memory datastore of entities and links
 * 3. It listens for messages from your blocks and updates its datastore appropriately (e.g. to create a new entity)
 * 4. It displays a debug UI allowing you to see the contents of its datastore, and messages sent back and forth
