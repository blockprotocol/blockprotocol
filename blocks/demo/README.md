# All-in-one Demo Block

## Purpose

The goal of this block is demonstrate a range of functionality related to use of Block Protocol modules.

It currently shows a range of Graph Module actions, including creating entities, linking entities together, querying for multiple entities, and deleting entities.

## See it in action

From this folder

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

From outside a workspace:

```sh
yarn && yarn workspace @blocks/demo dev
```

## Inspecting the source code

To see how the functionality is implemented, start in `src/app.tsx`.

For more details on the Block Protocol visit [our docs](https://blockprotocol.org/docs).
