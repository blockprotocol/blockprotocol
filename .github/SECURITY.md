# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Security updates are only published for the latest minor version of each of our packages.** We have no expectation of beginning to publish security patches for older versions of our packages in the near future.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the work of security researchers who help keep our users safe. To responsibly and confidentially disclose vulnerabilities in any of the Block Protocol's hosted code, email a report to [security@hash.ai](mailto:security@hash.ai) or via HASH's online contact form at [hash.ai/contact](https://hash.ai/contact)

## More Information

The Block Protocol is currently primarily maintained by [HASH](https://hash.ai/). You can read more about HASH's approach to security on their website at [hash.ai/security](https://hash.ai/security)
