## Block Hub

Once you've built a block, you can add it to the [Block Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), so that:

- your block will have an instant online demo playground
- your block will be searchable via our block API
- you can claim your namespace in blockprotocol.org

To publish a block on the hub, the initial process is as follows:

1.  Have your block source code available in a GitHub repository
1.  Claim your username by signing up at [https://blockprotocol.org](https://blockprotocol.org)
1.  Fork the [`blockprotocol` repository](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol)
1.  Add a JSON file to the [hub folder](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/hub), in a subfolder matching the username you registered in step one, preceded by the `@` symbol (e.g. `@myusername`)
1.  [Create a pull request](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/compare) from your fork

The JSON metadata file should look like this:

```json5
{
  // REQUIRED - path to the repository with your block's source code
  repository: "https://github.com/hashintel/dev.git",
  // REQUIRED - name of the branch to build your block from
  branch: "main",
  // REQUIRED - name of the folder your built blocks will appear in after running `yarn build`
  distDir: "dist",
  // REQUIRED - used to modify yarn commands & uniquely identify your block
  workspace: "@hashintel/block-embed",
}
```

We assume that running `yarn install && yarn build` will create your block's distribution in the specified `distDir`,
unless `workspace` is provided, in which case we will modify both yarn commands with the provided workspace.
