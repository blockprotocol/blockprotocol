## Block Hub

Once you've built a block, you can add it to the [Block Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), so that:

- your block will have an instant online demo playground
- your block will be searchable via our block API
- you can claim your namespace in blockprotocol.org

To publish a block on the hub, the initial process is as follows:

1.  Have your block source code available in a GitHub repository
1.  Claim your username by signing up at [https://blockprotocol.org](https://blockprotocol.org)
1.  Fork the [`blockprotocol` repository](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol)
1.  Add a JSON file to the [hub folder](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/hub), in a subfolder matching the username you registered in step one, preceded by the `@` symbol (e.g. `@myusername`)
1.  [Create a pull request](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/compare) from your fork

The JSON metadata file should look like this:

```json5
{
  // REQUIRED - path to the repository with your block's source code
  repository: "https://github.com/hashintel/hash.git",
  // REQUIRED - commit hash (pins block to a specific version)
  commit: "adb915bf8fc4f84e33a2cd21f217225e50c3d7fa",

  // IF NEEDED - see below
  distDir: "dist",
  folder: "packages/blocks/block-embed",
  workspace: "@hashintel/block-embed",
}
```

If `distDir` is not provided, we assume that the block is ready to be deployed without building.
This usually applies to simple blocks with little or no JavaScript.
If your simple block is located in a subfolder, use `folder` to define its path.

If `distDir` is provided, we assume that that running `yarn install && yarn build` will create your blockâ€™s distribution in the specified `distDir`.
If your repo contains `package-lock.json` instead of `yarn.lock`, we will run `npm install && npm run build`.

If you provide `folder`, the above commands will run in a specific part of your repository source.

Providing `workspace` replaces `yarn build` with `yarn workspace [your workspace] build`, which is needed in monorepos.

Specified `distDir` will be relevant to `workspace` directory or `folder`, if provided.
