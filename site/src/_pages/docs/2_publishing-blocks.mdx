## Block Hub

Once you've built a block, you can add it to the [Block Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), so that:

- your block will have an instant online demo playground
- your block will be searchable via our block API
- you can claim your namespace in blockprotocol.org

To publish a block on the hub, the initial process is as follows:

1.  Have your block source code available in a GitHub repository
1.  Claim your username by signing up at [https://blockprotocol.org](https://blockprotocol.org)
1.  Fork the [`blockprotocol` repository](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol)
1.  Add a JSON file to the [hub folder](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/hub), in a subfolder matching the username you registered in step one, preceded by the `@` symbol (e.g. `@myusername`)
1.  [Create a pull request](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/compare) from your fork

The JSON metadata file should look like this:

```json5
{
  // REQUIRED - path to the repository with your block's source code
  repository: "https://github.com/hashintel/hash.git",
  // REQUIRED - commit hash (pins block to a specific version)
  commit: "adb915bf8fc4f84e33a2cd21f217225e50c3d7fa",

  // IF NEEDED - see below
  distDir: "dist",
  folder: "packages/blocks/block-embed",
  workspace: "@hashintel/block-embed",
}
```

**My block source is in a subfolder**

- If it’s in a yarn workspace, please provide `workspace`
- If it’s not in a yarn workspace, please provide its `folder` path

**My block requires building from its source**

- please provide the `distDir` where the build artifacts will appear

<InfoCard variant="info" title="Note">

We assume that running `yarn install && yarn build` will build your block (after switching to the relevant folder/workspace, if provided).
The specified `distDir` will be relative to the workspace directory or folder, if provided.
