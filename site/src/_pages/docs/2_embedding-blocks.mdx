## Overview

This guide covers a few key points to consider when writing or updating an application to use blocks,
and is a companion to the [embedding application section of the block protocol specification](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/embedding-application-implementation).

## Discovering blocks

You can browse prototype blocks in the [block hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub) right now.
You can view their schema (the structure of data they accept), and see how they look given different data.

We will launch an API to search blocks in January. As well as listing blocks and searching by name,
this will enable you to provide a data object, and be told which blocks can display or edit it.

For example, if you provide `{ "name": "Bob", email: "bob@test.com" }`, the API will suggest the
[person block](https://blockprotocol.org/@hash/person).

Once your app implements the block protocol, your users can search and use blocks to work with a
wide variety of data structures, without further effort on your part.

If you want to know when the API launches, please [register your interest](https://blockprotocol.org/partners).

## Building the block's properties

Applications need to provide blocks with:

- the entity data that the block will allow users to visualize or edit,
- links between entities, and
- functions and ids to use when updating entities.

These are described in detail in [the specification](https://blockprotocol-git-dev-hashintel.vercel.app/spec/block-types#data-provided-to-blocks),
and we draw out some key points below.

### Providing data

The block protocol deals with things called _entities_ and separate things called _links_,
which link entities together.

This data model is intended to be generic and extensible: to allow new entity types to be defined on the fly
and linked to any other arbitrary entity, and to enable translation back and forth between a range of other data models.

You may need to normalize data to the expected format. Some points to consider:

**1. Each entity should have an `entityId` and an `entityTypeId`, both of which must be strings.**

These will be provided by blocks when requesting updates to an entity (see [handling block actions](#handling-block-actions)).

For example, a row in a `companies` table like the following:

| id  | name |
| --- | ---- |
| 456 | Acme |

...might become:

```json
{
  "entityId": "456",
  "entityTypeId": "Company",
  "name": "ACME"
}
```

**2. Links between entities are represented as separate records, rather than as properties on an entity.**

If you want blocks to allow users to visualize or edit links between entities, you should provide them to blocks.

This might mean translating links encoded on your records directly into separate objects.

If you don't have separate links in your own data model, you would ideally give the links you create
a unique, stable id so that blocks can track them across time.

For example, a row in your `users` table:

| id  | name | companyId |
| --- | ---- | --------- |
| 41  | Bob  | 456       |

...might become the following entity:

```json
{
  "entityId": "41",
  "entityTypeId": "User",
  "name": "Bob"
}
```

...and the following link (assuming you didn't already have a `linkId` and generate one):

```json
{
  "linkId": "user-42-company-456",
  "sourceEntityId": "42",
  "destinationEntityId": "456",
  "path": "company"
}
```

Links should be provided to blocks under the `linkGroups` field, [as described in the spec](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/block-types#linking-entities).

### Handling requests

Blocks request the creation or updating of _entities_ and _links_, via the functions you provide.

Blocks will send requests to update entities with the `entityId` and `entityTypeId` you provide with them,
and a payload which represents the properties to be assigned to that entity.

As blocks should be portable, they are not tied to a particular embedding context, and you will need to
provide functions which are a level of abstraction on top of your API or datastore.

For example, you may need to translate a call to `createEntity` with an `entityTypeId` of `"Company"`,
to a `POST` request to your `/companies` endpoint.

Depending on your data model, you may also need to translate requests related to links.

For example, you may need to translate a call to `createLink` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "sourceEntityId": "42",
  "sourceEntityTypeId": "User",
  "destinationEntityId": "789",
  "destinationEntityTypeId": "Company"
}
```

...into a call to set `companyId: "789"` on a user with id `42`, whether that's via a `PUT` request to `/users`,
a dedicated endpoint for assigning users to companies, or any other number of possible implementations.

## Rendering blocks

Once you have discovered a block you want to use, and have the data in the form it needs,
you need to put the two together on a webpage.

How exactly this is done will depend on your own application, and how the block is written.

A block will use the `externals` field in its `block-metadata.json` to indicate the key dependencies it
expects to be provided with (to keep block bundle size down), and this can also be used to infer how
it expects to be rendered.

For example, a block with `react` in its externals, and a JavaScript entry point, is likely a React component,
and the source can be used to create a function which is then rendered like any other React component,
with the required functions and properties passed in as `props`. Any dependencies it expects could be provided
by giving a `requires` function when creating the function.

A block with an HTML entry point could be added to the page like any other HTML element. Any dependencies it
expects could be attached to the scope of the document (we assume blocks are [sandboxed](#security)).

We will be releasing source code in January which demonstrates how all this can be done.

If you want to know when the example application code is available, please [register your interest](https://blockprotocol.org/partners).

## Security

You should take suitable precautions to ensure that block code is unable to compromise
your systems or take unexpected action on behalf of your users.

We will be providing source code for an example application which demonstrates one
potential approach to sandboxing block execution.
