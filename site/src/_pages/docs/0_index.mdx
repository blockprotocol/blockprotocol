## Overview

These pages provide a practical introduction to implementing the block protocol, whether you are:

- interested in [developing blocks](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/developing-blocks), or
- interested in [embedding blocks in your application](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/embedding-blocks)

For the full technical details, read [the Block Protocol specification](https://blockprotocol.org/spec).

If you have any questions, [please open or contribute to a discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions). You can also [chat to us on Discord](https://blockprotocol.org/discord).

## HASH: a demo application

We have published [the source code of our example embedding application, HASH](https://github.com/hashintel/hash).

This is a work-in-progress environment which illustrates how both blocks and an application using them can be implemented.
