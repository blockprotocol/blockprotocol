## Overview

These pages provide a practical introduction to implementing the block protocol, whether you are:

- interested in [developing blocks](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/quick-start-guide), or
- interested in [embedding blocks in your application](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/embedding-blocks)

For the full technical details, read [the block protocol specification](https://blockprotocol.org/spec).

## Demo application

We'll be releasing source code in January for various blocks and an application using them.

If you want to know when this source code is public, please [register your interest](https://blockprotocol.org/partners).
