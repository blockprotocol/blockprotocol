# RFCs & Roadmap

## Planned services

We will introduce the following new services to the Block Protocol to support additional functionality that requires application-block cooperation.

We welcome suggestions for other services that may be useful, via GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions) or by creating [RFCs](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/tree/main/rfcs).

### Actions

A generalized approach to capturing user actions could involve a service whereby a block reports on which elements within it capture actions (e.g. a button), and embedding applications could choose to bind further actions to them as a response.

### Comments

We want to facilitate users leaving comments on elements within blocks. This could be

- managed entirely outside the block, e.g. by a wrapper around the block which provides a context menu to users for adding comments on blocks – which avoids blocks having to have any knowledge of commenting, but could interfere with how the block wants to respond to user input, or
- managed by providing a new service whereby blocks could send messages requesting that comments be attached to specific elements in blocks – which allows blocks to have control over how and to what element the user is able to attach comments.

### Internationalization

A service to provide the user’s preferred locale to blocks. Please see the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions/315).

### Location

A service to provide the user’s location to blocks (with appropriate safeguarding).

### Styling

The styling service would involve the embedding application to communicate styling or theming data to blocks, to allow blocks to apply styling to make them appear more visually consistent with the application embedding them.

Please see the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions/180) for a discussion of what data might be transported as part of a styling service (e.g. a `styleObject`, or a CSS file).

### Hook

There will be a hook service, which will act as an escape hatch for embedding applications to ‘reach into’ blocks to directly render content, or to manipulate content rendered by the block . This will rely on cooperation from the block author.

### Users

Much familiar functionality requires a reference to the current user, or being able to select from users in the system. For example:

- reacting to a post (linking the current user to the post via a reaction)
- assigning a user to an action item (linking the current user to the action item)
- searching for users to mention (having user display names to select from and search)

A users service could help expose some of this data to blocks, with appropriate safeguarding and permissions sought.

### Versioning

While embedding applications can handle displaying an interface for reloading blocks at particular earlier versions, we will specify a way of communicating to blocks that (a) an earlier version is being displayed, and (b) the difference with the current version would allow blocks to implement visual diffs.

## Changes to existing services

### Core

#### Block definition

##### Block entry point

We currently provide that blocks can be exposed to applications in three different ways: as custom elements, HTML files, or React components. We may wish to reduce this to a single entry point.

Please [see the discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions/392) for more.

#### Service permissions / requirements

Applications may implement some services only, or implement part of a service only (e.g. allowing `createEntity` but not `createEntityType`).

Many blocks will require certain services, and parts of services.

Blocks will not work in applications that do not implement the services they require, and the parts of services they require. If there is a mismatch which is not identified prior to a block being selected for use, they may crash or be non-functional at the point of use.

##### Proposal

In order to predict in advance whether a given block will work in a given application, it would be helpful for blocks to be able to indicate which services and parts of services they require.

The most detailed version of this would be for blocks to be able to:

- express requirements/support at a service level (e.g. `requires: "graph"`), and
- express finer-grained detail, e.g.
  - which specific messages from a service they require/support
  - any additional detail on what they require from a message, which might be a particular scope, e.g. access to retrieve or create particular types of entities.

### Graph

#### Entity types

We’re intending to move away from entities having to fully describe the constraints of each of their properties.
Instead, type definitions are going to become shareable and reusable in a new type system which establishes
a hierarchy of types to address a number of shortcomings in our current system.
For in-depth motivation, a proposed implementation plan, and the wide-reaching implications [please see the RFC](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/pull/352).

#### Pagination

We intend to move to a cursor-based method for paginating aggregations of entities, likely based on the [Connections](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) specification.

#### Schema mapping

The Block Protocol does not seek to describe or prescribe the shape of particular entities (e.g. what fields a `Person` has).

Instead, it seeks to define the block-application interface.

This does, however, mean there is a possibility of competing schemas attempting to describe the same entities, which different blocks using different schema - reducing the portability of blocks.

The ability to translate between schemas would help - e.g. some way expressing an equivalence relationship between properties in different schema. This might be a keyword such as `sameAs` or `equivalentTo` mapping between schemas and their properties. Then, either blocks or embedding applications could programmatically translate between schemas.

Note that this is about translating between different JSON Schemas, and is not to be confused with the process of translating JSON schema to schema.org (and equivalent) types, which has an established technical approach mentioned **[here](/docs/faq#how-does-the-block-protocol-advance-the-semantic-web)**.
