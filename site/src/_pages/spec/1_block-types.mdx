# Block types

<InfoCard>

We have published [HASH, an example embedding application with example blocks](https://github.com/hashintel/hash).

You can see source code for an example block [here](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/packages/blocks/code).

We will be developing more complex blocks which demonstrate the full range of functionality described below.

We welcome feedback and suggestions - [please open or contribute to a discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions) to do so.

</InfoCard>

A block type should be packaged and distributed in a form which embedding applications can easily insert into a web page, and accompanied by metadata files describing the structure of data that the block accepts.
A block package might be made available via a URL, package manager, or catalog of block types.

A block package MUST contain:

- **source file or files** (e.g. HTML and JavaScript files)

  - where HTML is included, it SHOULD be valid HTML

A block package SHOULD contain:

- a JSON file **describing the properties the block accepts** using [JSON Schema vocabulary](https://json-schema.org/) â€“ the â€˜block schemaâ€™, which can be [automatically generated](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#from-code) from block code, and which:

  - MUST be called `block-schema.json`
  - If the block does not function without certain properties, MUST specify a [required](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.5.3) array naming them
  - SHOULD specify any further constraints or [validation](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html) requirements which improve the blockâ€™s functionality

- a JSON file containing **metadata describing the block**, which:

  - MUST be called `block-metadata.json`
  - MUST specify:

    - a `name` for the block
    - any libraries the block expects the embedding application to supply it with under `externals` â€“ i.e. libraries which the block depends on but does not include in its package â€“ using the name of the library as it is usually distributed (e.g. via npm), and the expected version (or version range).
      For example, a block may rely on React (`"externals": [{ "react": "^16.0.0" }]`), but assume that the embedding application will provide it, to save loading it multiple times on a page.
    - the path or URL to the entrypoint source file (e.g. `index.html`, `index.js`) under `source`
    - the `version` of the block, which SHOULD use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
    - `protocol`: the applicable block protocol version: currently `0.1`.

  - SHOULD specify:

    - `default` â€“ an object, conforming to the blockâ€™s schema, representing
      the default data that applications should provide when creating a block, unless (a) the block can handle being provided no data when first instantiated or (b) `variants` is provided (see below).
    - `examples` - an array of objects conforming to the block's schema which provide examples of the data that can be passed to it
    - `icon` â€“ an icon for the block, to be displayed when the user is
      selecting from available blocks (as well as elsewhere as appropriate, e.g.
      in a website listing the block)
    - `image` â€“ a preview image of the block for users to see it in action before using it. This would ideally have a 3:2 width:height ratio and be a minimum of 900x1170px.
    - `author`: a display name for the author of the block
    - `description`: a brief description of the block
    - `license`: the license the block is made available under (e.g. MIT)

  - MAY specify:

    - `variants` â€“ an array of objects, each with a `name`, `description`, `icon`, and `properties`, which represents different variants of the block that the user can create. As a simple example, a â€˜headerâ€™ block might have variants with the `name` â€˜Heading 1â€™ and â€˜Heading 2â€™, which start with `{ level: 1 }` and `{ level: 2 }` as `properties`, respectively.

## Data transfer

### Data provided to blocks

Blocks MUST use the data properties specified in their schema, if any.

They can expect these properties to be made available to them by the embedding application, exactly how depending on [rendering context](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/implementation-approaches#rendering-contexts).

The data for the block itself will be at the root level of the data made available to it, i.e. a block which had a `level` property at the root of the properties in its schema would have a `level` property passed to it.

#### Fields identifying entities

The blockâ€™s data represents an â€˜entityâ€™ in the system. Alongside the properties declared in its schema, blocks MUST expect certain fields to be provided by the embedding application, and MUST pass these fields back when requesting action with specific entities:

- `entityId`: an identifier for the entity
- `entityTypeId`: an identifier for the type/class of the entity
- `accountId`: an identifier for the account/namespace/user to which the entity belongs

These fields MUST be strings. Some MAY be left undefined.

The exact form of these will differ across applications â€“ e.g. some might use human-readable strings, others might use integers (passed as strings) or uuids.

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

It's vital to have a way of blocks identifying the entities they target for retrieval or modification.

The approach described above attempts to identify a selection of fields which in combination are sufficient to identify an entity for any application, with applications left to decide which to define.

Ideally, blocks would be able to rely on the concatenation of any supplied identifiers as a unique identifier for the entity within that application, so that the block can track unique entities. An alternative is to require in the specification that `entityId` is unique in the application, and leave it up to embedding applications to make it so.

We are also considering an alternative approach whereby the entity identifier is a single, opaque object or string which the block has no knowledge of the content of, except that it is sufficient to uniquely identify the entity.

This would have the advantage of the specification not needing to anticipate all the fields an application might need to reliably identify an entity.

It has the disadvantage of potentially losing the explicit recognition of fields which blocks might find useful for their internal workings (e.g. `entityTypeId` for grouping entities by type).

We welcome any thoughts or suggestions on this - [please open or contribute to a discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions) to get involved.

#### Fields for linked entities

The entity for the block might link to other entities.
For example, a Kanban board block might have a `team` property which links to another type of entity, a Team.

Blocks SHOULD expect the following additional fields related to linked data to be passed to them:

- a `linkedEntities` field containing the entities linked from the blockâ€™s entity, and entities linked to from those entities, and so on. This field SHOULD contain all entities which have been resolved in the graph (rather than just those linked directly from the block entity), i.e. these are the **nodes** in a graph resolved from the block entity to a certain depth (see callout below).

- a `linkGroups` field which provides the links attached to the block or the entities provided in `linkedEntities`, grouped by entity and path, i.e. these are the **edges** of the graph.

- a `linkedAggregations` field containing the results of aggregations linked from the blockâ€™s entity - these are special links which represent an aggregation operation (e.g. in plain English, "top 10 Cars sorted by age, descending"), which are provided in this field along with the results of the operation at the time of request.

Each entity provided under `linkedEntities` or `linkedAggregations` will also have [identifying fields](#fields-identifying-blocks) to be used as arguments when updating those entities.

See [linking entities](#linking-entities) for a discussion of how links are managed.

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

There must be a limit on what links are followed from a block entity when providing data to it - if any are at all.

The specification currently suggests that at least _some_ links are followed (otherwise there would be no `linkedEntities` at all).

It could alternatively specify:

1.  A default depth - e.g. 1, so that entities immediately linked from the block are included, but not any further.
1.  That _no_ links should be followed, with blocks requesting linked entities as needed
1.  That blocks can express their desired depth somehow, based on their functional requirements.

Our own [work-in-progress embedding application](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/packages/hash) uses a depth of 1-2 (for individual linked entities and linked aggregations, respectively), which aims to balance speed of block operation (by having more data available immediately) with avoiding resolving tons of data. As we develop more complex blocks we will update our view, and we welcome feedback.

</Frame>

#### Type fields

Where available, blocks SHOULD expect and handle an `entityTypes` field containing entity type definitions for any entities sent to the blocks, which can be parsed to understand the constraints on user input for each entity (e.g. which fields are editable, what sort of data they accept).

Each entry in the `entityTypes` array is a JSON schema object with an additional `entityTypeId` field corresponding to the `entityTypeId` of the entities it describes the shape of (which MAY be different to the URI value for the standard JSON schema `$id` property).

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

The Block Protocol does not seek to describe or prescribe the shape of particular entities (e.g. what fields a `Person` has).

Instead, it seeks to define the block-application interface.

This does, however, mean there is a possibility of competing schemas attempting to describe the same entities, which different blocks using different schema - reducing the portability of blocks.

The ability to translate between schemas would help - e.g. some way expressing an equivalence relationship between properties in different schema. This might be a keyword such as `sameAs` or `equivalentTo` mapping between schemas and their properties. Then, either blocks or embedding applications could programmatically translate between schemas.

</Frame>

### Entity functions

Subject to [the permissions granted to them by the embedding application](#block-permissions), blocks can expect functions with the names and signatures listed below to be made available to them, i.e. to be passed in along with the properties defined in their schema, or to be otherwise made available in their scope depending on their [implementation](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/implementation-approaches).

Blocks should have sensible fallbacks for when permissions are denied them, or when functions are absent, for example:

- **implementing a readonly / display mode for data which they are unable to edit**: for example, embedding applications may choose to use blocks to display data as part of a static page, rather than in an editing environment.

- **hiding or disabling specific controls depending on the specific permissions granted them**: for example, hiding a 'delete' button if delete permissions have been denied.

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

There are various ways in which we may change the approach described here:

1.  Finer-grained updates to entities - rather than sending data objects with multiple keys and values as described below - would be useful in supporting an embedding application to implement collaborative editing and undo/redo stacks.
1.  There are many functions listed. We could consolidate them in a single 'do something' function, with the type of action required specified.
1.  Making functions available in the block's scope may not be the best way of handling action requests. One alternative, at least in a web context, is to define [custom DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events) which are dispatched from blocks and listened for by embedding applications.

There are also many other functions/operations one can imagine being useful for blocks, beyond the basic CRUD operations described below, e.g.

1.  Useful, common operations which may not map onto entities in a data store, e.g. `getLocation`
1.  Operations to handle data transfer in different ways than a single operation, e.g. subscriptions
1.  Compound operations which bundle other operations together for convenience

Any operations specified in the protocol should be useful in a wide variety of contexts. We welcome ideas!

- Embedding apps SHOULD provide a default aggregation if not provided.

The functions defined above return entity data, but block authors should note that in many [implementations](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/embedding-application-implementation) the embedding application will re-render a block with new entity data whenever it is updated (whether by the block or some other actor), e.g. the block will automatically get sent new data via props when any entity it has previously received via props is updated.

### Entity type functions

Where supported and permitted by the embedding application, blocks SHOULD be provided with the following functions to work with entity types, i.e. data models.

```block-function
createEntityTypes(actions: CreateEntityTypesAction[]): Promise<EntityType[]>
```

creates one or more entity types.

**returns:** the created entity types, i.e. _objects_ inside an _array_.
An `EntityType` is a JSON schema object with an additional `entityTypeId` field and optional `accountId` field.

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`CreateEntityTypesAction<T>`), each with the following shape:

- `accountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the account to create the entity type in.
- `schema` \[_object_]: the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
  for the entity type.

```block-function
updateEntityTypes(actions: UpdateEntityTypesAction[]): Promise<EntityType[]>
```

updates one or more entity types.

**returns:** the updated entity types

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`UpdateEntityTypesAction<T>`), each with the following shape:

- `accountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the account of the entity type to update.
- `entityTypeId` \[_string_]: the id of the entity type to update.
- `schema` \[_object_]: the JSON schema for the entity type.

```block-function
deleteEntityTypes(actions: DeleteEntityTypesAction[]): Promise<boolean[]>
```

deletes one or more entity types.

**returns:** an _array_ of _boolean_ indicating the success of each operation.

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`DeleteEntityTypesAction<T>`), each with the following shape:

- `accountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the account of the entity type to delete.
- `entityTypeId` \[_string_]: the entity type to delete.

```block-function
getEntityTypes(actions: GetEntityTypesAction[]): Promise<EntityType[]>
```

retrieves one or more entity types.

**returns:** the retrieved entity types, i.e. _objects_ inside an _array_.

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`GetEntityTypesAction<T>`), each with the following shape:

- `accountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the account of the entity type to retrieve.
- `entityTypeId` \[_string_]: the entity type to retrieve.

```block-function
aggregateEntityTypes(payload: AggregateEntityTypesPayload): Promise<AggregateEntitiesResult>
```

retrieve one or more entity types.

**returns:** an `AggregateEntitiesResult`, where the `results` field contains an array of entity types.

**accepts:** an _object_ (`AggregateEntityTypesPayload`), with the following shape:

- `accountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the account of the entity types to retrieve.
- `operation?`: [an aggregating entities operation](#aggregate-entities-operation), omitting `entityTypeId`.

### Linking entities

Another special set of functions provided to blocks relate to managing links between entities.

When creating or updating an entityâ€™s data, including its own, blocks will often wish to express
that a certain property on an entity should be a reference to another entity.

- For example, that a Personâ€™s employer field should point to a particular Company entity.

A block may also wish to link one of its properties to a particular aggregation of entities.

- For example, a table block displaying the Top 10 people sorted by some property of Person,
  will need a way of encoding this aggregation in its data.

In order to create a reference to a separate entity or entities as the desired value of a particular field, blocks SHOULD create a `Link` <a id="link-object" />, which:

- MUST contain:
  - `sourceEntityId` \[_string_]: the `entityId` of the source entity.
  - `path` \[_string_]: the path to the field on the source entity this link is conceptually made on, expressed as a [JSON path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
  - EITHER:
    - `destinationEntityId` \[_string_] â€“ the id of a single entity the link is made to, OR
    - `operation` â€“ an aggregation operation which the embedding application should resolve the link to, following the structure of the `operation` object [described above](#aggregate-entities-operation).
- MAY contain

  - `destinationEntityAccountId?`: \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `accountId` of the destination entity or account to aggregate entities from.
  - `sourceEntityVersionId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: optionally specify that this link is only from a specific version.
  - `sourceAccountId?`: \[_string_]\[_optional_]:: the `accountId` of the source entity.
  - `sourceEntityTypeId?`: \[_string_]\[_optional_]:: the `entityTypeId` of the source entity.

- if `destinationEntityId` is defined, MAY contain:
  - `destinationEntityVersionId:` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: to pin the link to a specific version of the destination entity.
  - `destinationEntityTypeId?`: \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `entityTypeId` of the destination entity.
  - `index` \[_integer_]: the position of this link in a list (for where ordering of links is important).

Once created, a `Link` includes a `linkId`.

**Example 1.** creating a `Link` with the following data indicates that this particular user should be linked to a company with id `company1`, and that the link conceptually is made on the userâ€™s `employer` field:

```json
{
  "sourceEntityId": "user1",
  "destinationEntityId": "company1",
  "path": "employer"
}
```

When delivering data to blocks the resolved data for entity `company1` will be provided _separately_ to `user1`, in the `linkedEntities` array, rather than injected into the properties of the user, and the link itself available in the `linkGroups` array provided to the block.

**Example 2.** creating a `Link` with the following data indicates that this particular table should be linked to the top 10 sales by value, and that the link is conceptually made on the tableâ€™s `rows` field:

```json
{
  "sourceEntityId": "table1",
  "path": "rows",
  "aggregate": {
    "entityTypeId": "sales",
    "multiSort": [{ "field": "value", "desc": true }],
    "itemsPerPage": 10,
    "pageNumber": 1
  }
}
```

When delivering the data this data would be provided _alongside_ the table, in the `linkedAggregations` array.

---

Links between specific entities - **edges** in the graph - will be provided to a block under a `linkGroups` field, which is an array of objects,
each of which specifies a source entity, a path (field name), and the links on that path.

```json
{
  "sourceEntityId": "user1",
  "path": "company",
  "links": [
    {
      "sourceEntityId": "user1",
      "destinationEntityId": "company1",
      "path": "company"
    }
  ]
}
```

N.B. this data structure has been chosen to allow for later pagination of links on a field.

The entities linked to - the **nodes** in the graph - will be provided under `linkedEntities`
(and the entities they link onwards to, depending on the depth the graph is resolved to from the starting entity).

An entry in linkedAggregations follows the shape of the [`AggregateEntitiesResult` object](#aggregate-entities-result),
with the addition of:

- `sourceAccountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `accountId` of the source entity.
- `sourceEntityId` \[_string_]: the `entityId` of the source entity.
- `sourceEntityTypeId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `entityTypeId` of the source entity.
- `path`: \[_string_]: the `path` on the source entity to which this aggregation is linked.

To create, update and delete links between entities, blocks SHOULD expect the following functions to be made available to them:

```block-function
createLinks(actions: CreateLinksAction[]): Promise<Link[]>
```

creates one or more links.

**returns:** the created links, i.e. _objects_ inside an _array_ (now with `linkId`)

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`CreateLinksAction`) -
each object is a [`Link`](#link-object), omitting `linkId`.

```block-function
updateLinks(actions: UpdateLinksAction[]): Promise<Link[]>
```

updates one or more links.

**returns:** the updated links, i.e. _objects_ inside an _array_

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`UpdateLinksAction`), each with the following shape:

- `linkId` \[_string_]: the id of the link to update.
- `data` \[_object_]: the [`Link`](#link-object) to overwrite the existing one with.

```block-function
deleteLinks(actions: DeleteLinksAction[]): Promise<boolean[]>
```

deletes one or more links.

**returns:** an _array_ of _boolean_ indicating the success of each operation.

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`DeleteLinksAction`), each with the following shape:

- `sourceAccountId?` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `accountId` of the source entity.
- `sourceEntityId` \[_string_]\[_optional_]: the `entityId` of the source entity.
- `linkId` \[_string_]: the entity type to delete.

```block-function
getLinks(actions: GetLinksAction[]): Promise<Link[]>
```

retrieve one or more links.

**returns:** the retrieved links, i.e. _objects_ inside an _array_.

**accepts:** a single _array_ of _objects_ (`GetLinksAction`), each with the following shape:

- `linkId` \[_string_]: the link to retrieve.

#### Describing links in JSON schema

Where blocks wish to express in their schema â€“ or in the schema of any other entity type â€“ that the value of a field should be a link to another entity, they can use the JSON schema [$ref](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#ref) keyword when describing the accepted types for the field.
The value of the $ref should be the value of $id in the JSON schema for the target type.

Any linked entities MUST be provided by embedding applications either:

- in the `linkedEntities` field, where the expected type is a single entity or a list of specific entities (with the `linkGroups` field describing the links)
- in the `linkedAggregations` field, where the expected type is the result of an aggregation operation (e.g. Top 10 X, ordered by Y).
  See [linking entities](#linking-entities) for more on these fields.

Where blocks wish to express that a property in a schema is the _inverse of_ another property, they can use an `inverseOf` keyword with a $ref pointing to the relevant schema and property. Embedding applications can use `inverseOf` declarations to resolve inverse links without blocks needing to create them in both directions.

E.g. to express that a companyâ€™s `employees` field is the inverse of usersâ€™ `employer` field:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/company",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "employees": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": { "$ref": "https://example.com/schemas/user" }
      },
      "inverseOf": {
        "$ref": "https://example.com/schemas/user#/properties/employer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Limiting linked data returned

When requesting entity data via a block protocol function, blocks MAY include a `depth` field which will specify how many levels of linked entity data to resolve, to avoid expensive queries that pull in unneeded data from an extensive entity graph.
For example, a depth of 2 on a Person would resolve their linked Employer, and their Employerâ€™s linked Location, but no further.
A depth of 0 would resolve no links to other entities.

### Field summary

A block can expect the following fields to be made available to it, whether passed in as props or via another method appropriate to their rendering strategy:

### Block permissions

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

Embedding applications will wish to restrict the data that blocks can restrict or modify.

This will require several things we are developing:

1.  A syntax for capturing permissions (e.g. what action on what type of entity, or specific entity)
1.  The means by which blocks specify which permissions they either (a) require to function at all or (b) may wish to use
1.  The means by which embedding applications inform blocks of the permissions they have been granted

</Frame>

### Third-party data stores

Where blocks interact with third-party data stores, i.e. they send data for storage _outside_ the embedding application, they SHOULD where possible keep the entity data in the embedding application in sync, for example by:

- creating entities via the functions described above at the same time as creating records in other data stores

- reflecting any changes to entities provided by the embedding application if the user takes action to edit them in the block UI, by updating entities via the functions described above

Where changes to relevant entity data can occur in both the embedding application and the third-party data store _even when the block is not being used_, additional synchronization outside the block will be required to ensure consistent user data.

## Tracking user action

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

We are considering options for blocks reporting on user actions within them, both to allow the embedding application to track activity, and to be able to indicate user focus to other users where the application implements collaborative/multiplayer editing.

Potential options include:

- passing a `reportUserAction` function to blocks, to report on keypresses, drags, etc.

- passing a `usersFocus` property to blocks containing an array of focus objects, each indicating where different users are focused, to allow the block to render indicators.

- handling tracking user focus and rendering focus indicators outside of blocks.

Relatedly, we could require blocks to send finer-grained change steps when updating entities, to more precisely understand what actions users are taking within blocks and better reconcile them with other users' actions.

## Edit history

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

While embedding applications can handle displaying an interface for reloading blocks at particular earlier versions, we will specify a way of communicating to blocks that (a) an earlier version is being displayed, and (b) the difference with the current version would allow blocks to implement visual diffs and so on.

</Frame>

## Comments

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

We want to facilitate users leaving comments on elements within blocks.

This could be

- managed entirely outside the block, e.g. by a wrapper around the block which provides a context menu to users for adding comments on blocks â€“ which avoids blocks having to have any knowledge of commenting, but could interfere with how the block wants to respond to user input,or

- managed by providing functions to blocks to trigger a comment attached to specific elements in blocks â€“ which allows blocks to have control over how and to what element the user is able to attach comments, but means that blocks have to implement â€˜offer comment optionâ€™ behavior.

</Frame>

## Styling

Blocks SHOULD provide at least basic visual styling to allow them to be embedded and used without modification by any web application.

Blocks SHOULD use the theme variables provided under the `styleVariables` object and listed in [Appendix A](https://blockprotocol.org/spec/appendix-a-styling) as property values where appropriate, and provide [fallback values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties#custom_property_fallback_values) in case the embedding application does not define them.

<Frame emoji="ðŸ¤”">

We are considering alternative approaches to styling - [please contribute to the discussion](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/discussions/180) if you have questions or views.
