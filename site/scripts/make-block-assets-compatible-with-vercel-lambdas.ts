  // README.md and a few other file asset names are permanently excluded:
  // https://github.com/vercel/nft/blob/42defbaff909c2fedb5f8a385fed97c4c4f4713b/src/analyze.ts#L175
  // As a workaround, we copy README.md to README.vercel-hack.md, which does the job.
  //
  // It was also attempted to use fetch() instead of local file system calls. The calls
  // were hitting auth wall, possibly due to how internal Vercel security is implemented.
