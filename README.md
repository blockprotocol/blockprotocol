# Block Protocol

The Block Protocol is an open standard for building and using data-driven blocks. Blocks developed in accordance with the protocol allow you to make websites and applications that are both more useful to and readable by humans and machines.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [Block Protocol documentation](https://blockprotocol.org/docs) for complete instructions on using the Block Protocol, including:

- developing new blocks;
- publishing blocks to the Block Hub; and
- embedding blocks within your application.

## Usage

We’ll be publishing an example of an embedding application for the Block Protocol in January 2022. In the meantime:

_For more examples, please refer to the [Block Protocol documentation](https://blockprotocol.org/docs) or browse the complete [Block Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub)._

## Roadmap

_We’ll be publishing a public roadmap for the Block Protocol soon._

See the [open issues](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
