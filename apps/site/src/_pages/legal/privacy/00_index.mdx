You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products," to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of Block Protocol. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Products and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it.

#### Organizations with which you engage

You may indicate, through your actions on Block Protocol, that you are willing to share your personal data with Organizations, as defined in Block Protocol's [Terms of Service](/legal/terms), who also use the Services. If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data, for example by having the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.

When you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see. Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account.

#### Service providers

We share your personal data with service providers who process the information on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, security, online advertising, and other similar services. Our service providers may process data in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where they operate facilities.

Such processing by service providers and any related cross border data transfers will be in compliance with applicable law.

#### Affiliates

We enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems, when affiliates provide services on our behalf, or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service.

#### For security purposes

We will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:

- protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
- operate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or
- protect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.

#### For legal disclosure

Block Protocol may disclose personal data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](/legal/privacy/user-data-legal-requests).

#### Change in control or sale

We may share your personal data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.

Please note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.

Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

### Your choices regarding our processing of your personal data

We provide choices about the personal data we collect about you. The choices you make will not apply to any personal data associated with an Organization under your Account.

Access, correction, and deletion. If you're a Block Protocol user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](/settings/profile) or [contacting Support](/contact). You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, by changing your cookie preferences, or by [contacting Support](/contact).

We retain and use your information as described in this Privacy Statement, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of your request. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as forked entities or types, contributions to other Users' entities or types, and comments in others' workspaces, will remain. Where possible we will delete or de-identify your personal data, including your username, from the author field of entities, types, and comments by associating them with a ghost user. However, we may be unable to change or delete data certain aspects of an entity or type's history — as the graph is designed to maintain an immutable record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.

If Block Protocol processes personal data other than your profile information, such as information about you Block Protocol receives from [third parties](#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your personal data by [contacting Support](/contact).

You can adjust the settings on your Account regarding the display of your personal data in private or public graphs or personal data processed in connection with Community Features by modifying your [profile settings](/settings/profile).

Additionally, if you are unable to access certain personal data we have via the means described above, you can request access by [contacting Support](/contact).

#### Data portability

Data portability is one of our core tenets, which we refer to internally as our "[non-negotiable principle](https://hash.dev/blog/one-principle)". As a Block Protocol User, you can always take your data with you. You can download your data and the information we have about you at any time, and you can use the Block Protocol's open-source code and standards without relying on the Block Protocol's hosted services.

#### Communication preferences

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have control over how your email address is used and shared with other Users on and through our Service. You may manage your communication preferences from your personal [notification settings](/settings/notifications) page.

Depending on these settings, Block Protocol may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes to endpoints, blocks or types that you're using, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you.

Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

### Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

#### Cookies and tracking technologies

Block Protocol uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of the Block Protocol. We provide more information about [cookies on the Block Protocol](/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data as described [here](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

##### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like hash.ai/resources, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like hash.ai/resources, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

##### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The Block Protocol Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. Block Protocol will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on hash.ai/resources.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Required Cookies | Block Protocol uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.    |
| Analytics        | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.                                                                                                                                  |
| Social Media     | Block Protocol and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on Block Protocol’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by Block Protocol.           |
| Advertising      | In addition, Block Protocol and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |

##### What are your cookie choices and controls?

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1.  **Specifically on Block Protocol Enterprise Marketing Pages**

Any Block Protocol page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.

2.  **Generally for all websites**
    You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

- If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, Block Protocol will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
- Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
- You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If Block Protocol detects the GPC signal from your device, Block Protocol will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
- Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
  - United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
  - Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
  - Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

### Retention of personal data

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your personal data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes.

### How Block Protocol secures your information

Block Protocol takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account contains private or unpublished information, you control the access to that Content. Block Protocol personnel do not access private information except:

- to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law,
- to maintain the integrity of the Service;
- to programatically scan for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service;
- for security purposes;
- to assist you with support matters in relation to private information in your account or an account you control;
- or with your consent.

Block Protocol personnel access to private information is continuously logged and regularly audited. Block Protocol will provide notice regarding private project and data access unless prohibited from doing so by law, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

#### Cross-border data transfers

Block Protocol may store and process your personal data in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Block Protocol or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.

We transfer personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses using the contact details provided below.

### U.S. State Data Privacy

If you are a U.S. resident, we process your personal data in accordance with applicable U.S. state data privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing [privacy@hash.ai](mailto:privacy@hash.ai). Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.

California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted.
