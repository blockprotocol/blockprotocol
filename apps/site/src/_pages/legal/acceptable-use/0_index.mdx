You will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without our express written permission.

You may use information from our Service for the following reasons, regardless of whether the information was scraped, collected through our API, or obtained otherwise:

-  **Researchers** may use public, non-personal information from the Service for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access).
-  **Archivists** may use public information from the Service for archival purposes.

## 9. Excessive Bandwidth Use

The Service's bandwidth limitations vary based on the features you use. If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other users of similar features, we reserve the right to suspend your Account, throttle your file hosting, or otherwise limit your activity until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption. We also reserve the right—after providing advance notice—to delete repositories that we determine to be placing undue strain on our infrastructure. For more details on specific features' bandwidth limitations, see the [Block Protocol Additional Product Terms](/legal/terms/products).

## 10. Advertising on the Block Protocol

**Short version:** *We do not generally prohibit use of the Block Protocol for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so the Block Protocol does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.*

While we understand that you may want to promote your Content by posting supporters' names or logos in your Account, the primary focus of the Content posted in or through your Account to the Service should not be advertising or promotional marketing. This includes Content posted in or through Blocks, Types, Services, Pages, Packages, Projects, repositories, and all other parts of the Service. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents or project description sections associated with your Account, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on the Block Protocol. You may not advertise in other Users' Accounts, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.

You may not promote or distribute content or activity that is illegal or otherwise prohibited by our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms) or [Acceptable Use Policies](/legal/acceptable-use), including excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), get-rich-quick schemes, and misrepresentation or deception related to your promotion.

If you decide to post any promotional materials in your Account, you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials. We reserve the right to remove any promotional materials or advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any Block Protocol terms or policies.

## 11. User Protection

You must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users.   
  
We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole.
