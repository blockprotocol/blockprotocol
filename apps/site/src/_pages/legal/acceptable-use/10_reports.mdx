## Reporting Abuse

## About reporting abuse or spam

The Block Protocol provides a baseline code of conduct for everyone who uses its services. For more information, see our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms) and [Community Guidelines](/legal/community).

You can report users that have violated either of these policies through our [support form](/contact). You can also report many types of content inline from the [Block Protocol Hub](/hub) directly.

Certain types of content may also be reported directly to the project's maintainers, if they have opted in to provide a first line of moderation for their own projects and published pages.

Users in India can contact the Block Protocol's Grievance Officer for India using our [support form](/contact).

## Reporting an account
