# Using Blocks

Block Protocol (**Þ**) blocks can be used in a variety of different environments.

## Environments

### Now available

#### HASH

HASH is a block-based knowledge management, business intelligence and tool-building application.

- The hosted version of HASH is [available for early access](https://hash.ai) and is in alpha
- HASH is open source, and its code can be downloaded from the [`hashintel/hash` GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashintel/hash) - _please note that the `main` branch is currently unstable_

#### WordPress

The [Block Protocol for WordPress](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress) plugin adds support for Þ blocks within the existing WordPress Gutenberg editor. It can be downloaded directly from [the WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockprotocol/), or by any WordPress admin via the 'Plugins' screen in their `wp-admin`, by searching for the "Block Protocol".

### Planned environments

#### Figma

**We are planning support for Block Protocol blocks in both _Figma_ and _FigJam_.** Development has not yet begun. If you are interested in getting involved, please [let us know](https://blockprotocol.org/contact).

### Other environments

Information regarding additional planned embedding environments will be posted here as it becomes available.

#### Make a suggestion

If there's an application you'd like to see us exploring, please [reach out](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) to us.

#### Your own application

Alternatively, if you're an application developer interested in implementing the Block Protocol within your own app, allowing your users to insert blocks and use services from the [Þ Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), please [reach out to us](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) and we'll be in touch. While the protocol remains under heavy active development, we haven't yet released public documentation covering this process, but doing so is on our [roadmap](https://blockprotocol.org/roadmap).

You can also [register for updates](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) to get notified when we release new docs and tools for embedders.
