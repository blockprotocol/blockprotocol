# Using Blocks

Block Protocol (**Þ**) blocks can be used in a variety of different environments.

## Environments

### Now available

#### HASH

HASH is a block-based knowledge management, business intelligence and tool-building application.

- The hosted version of HASH is [available for early access](https://hash.ai) and is in alpha
- HASH is open source, and its code can be downloaded from the [`hashintel/hash` GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashintel/hash) - _please note that the `main` branch is currently unstable_

#### WordPress

The [Block Protocol for Wordpress](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress) plugin adds support for Þ blocks within the existing WordPress Gutenberg editor. It can be downloaded directly from [the WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockprotocol/), or by any WordPress admin via the 'Plugins' screen in their `wp-admin`, by searching for the "Block Protocol".

### Planned environments

#### GitHub Blocks

**We are in the early stages of building out support for Block Protocol blocks in _GitHub_.** Blocks are currently only available in GitHub as part of the _GitHub Next_ early release program, but ultimately this should allow blocks you develop in accordance with the Block Protocol spec to be used within GitHub markdown READMEs interactively, and elsewhere on _GitHub.com_.

#### Figma

**We are planning support for Block Protocol blocks in both _Figma_ and _Figjam_.** Development has not yet begun. If you are interested in getting involved, please let us know on [our Discord](https://blockprotocol.org/discord).

### Other environments

Support for additional embedding environments will arrive throughout 2023.

#### Make a suggestion

If there's an application you'd like to see us exploring, please [reach out](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) to us.

#### Your own application

Alternatively, if you're an application developer interested in implementing the Block Protocol within your own app, allowing your users to insert blocks and use services from the [Þ Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), please [reach out to us](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) and we'll be in touch. While the protocol remains under heavy active development, we haven't yet released public documentation covering this process, but doing so is on our [roadmap](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/roadmap).

You can also [register for updates](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) to get notified when we release new docs and tools for embedders.
