# Hook Service

This document (version 0.1) defines a **hook service** according to the terms set out in the core specification.

Under the hook service, a block can invite embedding application to take over the rendering of an element within the block (the **hook**), allowing embedding applications to provide users with application-specific **views** of specific data types without the block needing to know about them.

The service is designed to meet the following aims:

- embedding applications providing a consistent 'look and feel' across blocks for displaying or editing values of a particular type (e.g. rich text or image editing)
- allowing blocks to be portable across applications which use bespoke systems or data structures for displaying or editing values of a particular type (e.g. there is no universal “rich text” representation for blocks to parse and produce)

The service meets these aims by allowing blocks to delegate visualizing and editing functionality upwards to the embedding application.

The hook service is dependent on [the graph service](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/graph-service), as it relies on the existence of **entities** – use of the graph service is a prerequisite for use of the hook service.

## Glossary

**Hook:** an injection point blocks provide to embedding applications to allow them to optionally render or modify already rendered views associated with a property for an entity.

**View:** the elements the embedding application renders inside the hook (and associated functionality). A view may display read-only data or present editable data at the application’s discretion.

## Establishing hooks

### <Hidden>Establishing hooks </Hidden>Summary

Blocks initiate hooks by asking embedding applications to take over a DOM node (the hook) and render the application’s preferred view of data of a specified type.

### <Hidden>Establishing hooks </Hidden>Specification

To request a view is rendered into a hook, a block MUST send a `hook` [message](https://www.notion.so/Hook-service-spec-1fcc185dc67c4ce7ace06878a144977d). The value for `hookId` MUST be `null` when a block first establishes a hook.

If the embedding application **supports** the requested hook type:

- it MUST:
  - render a view informed by the contents of the `hook` message:
    - of the appropriate `type`
    - by manipulating the specified `node` or by attaching elements within it
    - using data stored at the specified `path` on the entity associated with the specified `entityId`
  - send a `hookResponse` message specifying a `hookId` to identify the hook with in future
- It MUST NOT destroy the node or move it within the DOM.

If the embedding application **does not** **support** the requested hook type, it MUST respond with an error with a code of `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

If any of the required data is missing from the `hook` message, the embedding application MUST respond with an error with a code of `INVALID_INPUT`.

## Updating hooks

### <Hidden>Updating hooks </Hidden>Summary

Blocks may request that a hook is updated or removed.

On removal, embedding applications should cease any further activity in relation to the DOM node.

Updating is a convenience for blocks to change aspects of a hook without having to send a message to destroy a hook followed by a message to establish a hook with the new parameters.

### <Hidden>Updating hooks </Hidden>Specification

**Removing hooks**

Once a hook has been established, blocks MAY request their removal by sending a `hook` message with the following values:

- for `hookId`: the id that was provided by the embedding application in the original `hookResponse` message
- for `node`: `null`
- for `entityId`, `type` and `path`: whatever values are currently applied to the hook

If an embedding application receives a `hook` message with a value of `null` for `node`, it MUST cease any activity and remove any subscriptions in relation to the `node` (e.g. it should not make further modifications to the node, and should remove event listeners).

**Updating hooks**

Once a hook has been established, blocks MAY vary its implementation by sending a `hook` message with the `hookId` provided in the original response, and the following values as desired:

- a new `type` to request that the type of view is changed
- a new `path` to request that the data used to populate the view is retrieved from and persisted to the `path` on the specified entity
- a new `entityId` to request that data from a new entity is used
- a new `node` to request that the view is rendered at a different place in the DOM

When a `hook` message is sent with a `hookId` corresponding to a previously-established hook, embedding applications MUST update the view for that hook according to the new parameters.

If such a message specifies a new `node`, the embedding application MUST follow the process for removing hooks for the previous `node` (e.g. cease modification of and remove subscriptions from that node).

## Hook data

### <Hidden>Hook data </Hidden>Summary

Hooks provide a way for applications to render their preferred view of data from a specific property belonging to a specific entity.

Applications should still provide the relevant data to the block, and should ensure that its representation matches that specified in the block’s schema (which may be different to how the application is using it in the hook).

### <Hidden>Hook data </Hidden>Specification

Embedding applications MUST use any value under the specified `path` in the properties in the specified entity to initialise the view they render.

As per the graph specification, embedding applications MUST provide a valid value for the specified `path` for any entity when sending data to the block. This may involve a different representation of the data than the application stores. For example, if an entity type specifies `type: "string"` for a property, and the application has stored data on that property as complex rich text objects (owing to previous or current use of the hook service for that property, or for some reason), the application MUST translate those rich text objects into a simple string when sending the property to the block, in order for the data send to comply with the entity schema.

## Hook types

### <Hidden>Hook types </Hidden>Summary

The type of a hook request indicates the type of data the block is requesting a view to be rendered for. The specification permits any string, but we expect particular use to be made of `text`, and to a lesser extent `image` and `video`.

As an example, take `text`. The data structure for formatted text may be bespoke to the embedding application, and impossible for the block to predictably parse or generate. The expected text editing experience may involve custom formatting controls, or special inline actions or commands. By using the hook service to inject its own rich text editing input, an embedding application can provide the desired experience and functionality.

### <Hidden>Hook types </Hidden>Specification

The `type` of a hook MUST be a string.

Embedding applications MUST render an appropriate view for the specified type, if they support it (e.g. a type of `text` should be rendered as something that appears to the user as text, however the application chooses to present it).

## Messages

### <Hidden>Message definitions </Hidden>Summary

There are only two messages in the hook service: the `hook` request from the block, and the `hookResponse` acknowledgement from the embedding application.

### <Hidden>Message definitions </Hidden>Specification

The messages available for exchange in the hook service are defined in the [service's JSON definition](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/packages/%40blockprotocol/hook/src/hook-service.json#L5) and are also
listed below for ease of reference.
