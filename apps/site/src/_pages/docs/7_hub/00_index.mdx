# Þ Hub

The Block Protocol (**Þ**) _**Hub**_ provides an easy way to discover, access and publish blocks, types, and services for free.

**The Þ Hub exists because interoperability without discoverability is of limited use.** The Þ Hub provides a single persistent, reliable, and open-source point of reference for the discovery of new Þ-compatible content. Creators only need to publish once, while embedding applications can easily discover new blocks, types and services, making them instantly available to their own users.

## Access

There are two ways to access the Þ Hub:

1.  **in-browser** by navigating to [`blockprotocol.org/hub`](https://blockprotocol.org/hub): no account is required to browse and test blocks
1.  **programmatically** from within other applications: either a user or an embedding application can create a free API key in order to query blocks from the Þ Hub via its [API](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/hub/api)

## Principles

The Block Protocol itself is an open-source standard. As a core principle of its existence, the Þ Hub is offered as a _convenience_ to protocol users, and is _not_ a required part of the protocol. Anybody can build a protocol-compliant block or application without ever connecting to or using the Þ Hub.

In the future, we'd like to decentralize the Þ Hub. It's likely we'll attempt this through a federated (server-to-server, or "ActivityPub style") mechanism, but we're focusing first on proving out the protocol's utility and obtaining a base level of adoption.
