# API

The Block Protocol (**Þ**) API is used exclusively to interface with the Þ Hub.

This allows for users to programmatically both **query** and **use** blocks, types and services, as well as securely **authenticate** themselves with external services.

## Using the API

To use the Þ API, you must first [register for an account](https://blockprotocol.org/signup).

Once [logged in](https://blockprotocol.org/login), navigate to the [Account > API Keys](https://blockprotocol.org/account/api) page to create a new key.

## About API Keys

Þ API keys can be attached to any programmatic request to access the Þ Hub, and serve as a means of authenticating your identity. As such, your full API key should be kept secret, like a password. Anybody with access to your full key can effectively access your account.

Þ API keys look something like this: `b10ck5.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY`

They are split into three parts:

1. the 'protocol identifier' (`b10ck5`), which is the same for all API keys.
2. the 'public portion' of your key (`X` above, which contains 32 characters). You can think of this as your 'username', which doesn't necessarily need to remain secret.
3. the 'private portion' of your key (`Y` above, which contains 36 characters). This is essentially your 'password', and it should remain secret and known only to you at all times.

If you believe the private portion of your key has become known to any unauthorized party, or has accidentally been made public (for example included in a code snippet uploaded to a website like GitHub) you should immediately revoke your key. You can revoke a key from the [Account > API Keys](https://blockprotocol.org/account/api) page.

Once an API key has been generated, it cannot be redisplayed. As such, you should consider generating a new key whenever you require one, or storing keys securely in an encrypted password manager upon generation.
