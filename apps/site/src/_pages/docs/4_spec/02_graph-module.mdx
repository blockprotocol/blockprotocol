# Graph Module

This document (version 0.3) defines a **graph module** according to the terms set out in the [core specification](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/core).

The graph module describes how **ontology types** and **entities** can be created, queried, updated, and linked together – including the **block entity**, represented by the **properties** sent to the block.

## Glossary

**Entity:** an instance of data, often corresponding to a thing in the world, constrained by a particular entity type.

**Link Entity:** a kind of entity which represents a connection or relation between its left and right entity, constrained by a link entity type.

**Left Entity:** the entity which is on the "left" of a specific link entity, in most situations this can be thought of as the "source" of the link.

**Right Entity:** the entity which is on the "right" of a specific link entity, in most situations this can be thought of as the "target" of the link.

**Ontology Type:** an element of the Block Protocol Type System, represented as a self-contained schema accessible via a URI. Ontology types are composed together to describe the shape of entities within the graph.

**Entity type:** an ontology type that defines the structure of an entity and its link entities. An entity type references other entity types and property types.

**Link Entity type:** an entity type which has a special marker to say it constrains a link entity.

**Property type:** an ontology type that defines the structure of an individual property within an entity. A property type references other property types and data types.

**Data type:** an ontology type that defines the possible space of possible values that an individual property can take within an entity.

**Graph:** a network of graph elements (entities, entity types, property types, and data types) connected by edges.

**Edge:** a directed connection between two graph elements which describes their relationship. Possible edges include those that describe references between types, or the relationship between the left and right entities of link entities.

**Subgraph:** a specific subset of a graph, usually returned as a result of a query. Can contain a set of roots which are distinguished elements of the subgraph, and usually correspond to the direct results of the query as the subgraph may contain other elements of the graph that were connected to the root elements through various edges.

**Block entity**: an entity associated with the specific instance of the block, conforming to block's specified entity type.

**Block Entity Subgraph:** a subgraph which contains the block entity as its root, with connected elements to a given depth.

## The Type System

The data model of the graph module is defined through its **Type System**.
The type system describes how a graph of **entities** is structured, through a composition of the 3 classes of **ontology types**, **data types**, **property types**, and **entity types**.

When composed, these types are capable of describing any JSON object.

### <Hidden>The Type System </Hidden>Data Types

A **data type** describes a space of possible valid _values_.
These cover all possible primitive values that can be represented within JSON, as well as `Object` and `Null` which are included for completeness of the system ([see the RFC for rationale](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/rfcs/text/0352-graph-type-system.md#including-an-empty-list-data-type)).

At present, there are 6 primitive data types.
New ones cannot be created, although that is a planned extension in the near-future, whereby new ones will be defined by combining the primitive data types and constraints such as max lengths, minimum values, etc. ([see the associated in-development RFC](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/pull/355)).

When represented as JSON schema, the 6 primitive data types are:

#### Text

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/text/v/1",
  title: "Text",
  description: "An ordered sequence of characters",
  type: "string",
}
```

#### Number

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/number/v/1",
  title: "Number",
  description: "An arithmetical value (in the Real number system)",
  type: "number",
}
```

#### Boolean

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/boolean/v/1",
  title: "Boolean",
  description: "A True or False value",
  type: "boolean",
}
```

#### Null

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/null/v/1",
  title: "Null",
  description: "A placeholder value representing 'nothing'",
  type: "null",
}
```

#### Object

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/object/v/1",
  title: "Object",
  description: "A plain JSON object with no pre-defined structure",
  type: "object",
}
```

#### Empty List

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://blockprotocol.org/types/modules/graph/data-type",
  kind: "dataType",
  $id: "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/data-type/empty-list/v/1",
  title: "Empty List",
  description: "An Empty List",
  type: "array",
  const: [],
}
```

### <Hidden>The Type System </Hidden>Property Types

A **property type** is the definition of the possible values that can be associated with a **property**.
When represented in JSON schema, a property type satisfies the following meta-schema:

<PropertyTypeMetaSchema />

### <Hidden>The Type System </Hidden>Entity Types

An **entity type** is the definition of the structure of an **entity**'s **properties**, and its outgoing **link entities** and their endpoint entities.
When represented in JSON schema, an entity type satisfies the following meta-schema:

<EntityTypeMetaSchema />

## Defining blocks

### Block package

#### <Hidden>Block package </Hidden>Summary

Blocks using the graph module provide an **entity type** which describes the shape of their **block entity**. Embedding applications should use this to constrain the properties they send to blocks when they are instantiated.

The versioned URL of the entity type's schema must be referenced in the block's `block-metadata.json` under a `schema` key.

Blocks may also add `default` and `examples` keys to `block-metadata.json` to define default and example properties conforming to their schema. If more complex example data is required that involves specifying _other_ entities and link entities between them, which the block will make use of, a block package may also include an `example-graph.json`.

#### <Hidden>Block package </Hidden>Specification

##### Blocks

A block using the graph module MAY expand `block-metadata.json` to specify:

- `schema`: the versioned URL of the **entity type** associated with the block entity. As per the specification, the schema hosted at the remote address should not be subject to change and versions of entity types should be treated as immutable, permanently available, records.

[//] # (- `default`: an **entity**, conforming to the block’s schema, representing the default data that applications should provide when creating a block, unless &#40;a&#41; the block can handle being provided no data when first instantiated or &#40;b&#41; `variants` is provided &#40;see below&#41;)

[//] # (- `examples`: an array of objects conforming to the block's schema which provide examples of the data that can be passed to it)

[//] # (- `variants`: an array of objects, each with a `name` and `properties`, and optionally `description`, `icon`, and `examples`. These objects represents different variants of the block that the user can create, where `properties` sets the starting properties. As a simple example, a ‘header’ block might have variants with the `name` ‘Heading 1’ and ‘Heading 2’, which start with `{ level: 1 }` and `{ level: 2 }` as `properties`, respectively)

If more complex example data is required, a block’s package may also include a file at the root named `example-graph.json`, which MUST be a JSON object, and MUST contain an `entities` key where each element is a JSON representation of an entity which MUST conform to the structure specified in [entity definition](#structure-specification).

##### Embedding applications

Embedding applications MUST use the constraints set in the associated entity type, to constrain the data it sends to the block in the **block entity subgraph**, assuming the embedding application implements the `blockEntitySubgraph` message.

Embedding applications MAY choose to display their own UI to allow users to set any values on the block entity described in `configProperties`, and could allow users to set values for them for all blocks of a type (rather than on a per-block instance basis)

## Entity definition

### Structure

#### <Hidden>Structure </Hidden>Summary

An entity is a combination of **metadata** and **properties**.

The **metadata** is a minimum collection of fields that are fixed and specified in this document, although embedding applications MAY choose to add their own.

The **properties** is a JSON object which satisfies the constraints of the entity’s **entity type**.

#### <Hidden>Structure </Hidden>Specification

##### Entities

When embedding applications pass entities to blocks, whether the **block entity** or any other:

- entities MUST be represented by an object, which:

  - MUST contain a field `metadata`, an object which:
  - MUST contain a field `recordId`, an object which:
    - MUST contain a field `entityId` identifying the entity, which MUST be a string.
    - MUST contain a field `editionId` which identifies the specific _edition_ of the entity, which MUST be a string, and MUST be unique for each edition of an entity for datastores that have versioning for their data.
  - MUST contain an `entityTypeId` identifying the entity type the entity belongs to, which MUST be a string.

  - MUST contain a field `properties` if the block has defined any `required` properties in its schema, and otherwise MAY be omitted. If present, it:
    - MUST be an object
    - MUST conform to the constraints described by the entity type of the entity
  - if the entity is a link entity it MUST contain a field `linkData` (and MUST not otherwise), an object which:
    - MUST contain a field `leftEntityId` identifying the left entity of the link, which MUST be a string
    - MUST contain a field `rightEntityId` identifying the right entity of the link, which MUST be a string
    - MAY contain a field `leftToRightOrder` used to order this link entity against other link entities of the same type with the same `leftEntityId`, which MUST be a non-negative integer
     - MAY contain a field `rightToLeftOrder` used to order this link entity against other link entities of the same type with the same `rightEntityId`, which MUST be a non-negative integer

i.e. any entity MUST conform to the following schema:

<EntityMetaSchema/>

### Identification

#### <Hidden>Identification </Hidden>Summary

Blocks must pass an `entityId` when making requests in respect of any entity.

Embedding applications should ensure this is stable and unique for any given entity.

#### <Hidden>Identification </Hidden>Specification

Blocks MUST provide `entityId` when identifying a particular entity for the purpose of **messages** under the graph module.

Embedding applications MUST provide `entityId` for each entity it supplies the block at the root of the entity data object, as described under [Structure](#structure) above.

`entityId` SHOULD be a stable, unique reference to the entity, so that blocks may use it for comparing the identity of entities – i.e. so that blocks can assume that entities with the same `entityId` are the same entity, and that the same entity referenced in different places will have the same `entityId` wherever it appears.

## Subgraph Definition



## Messages

### Error definitions

#### <Hidden>Error definitions </Hidden>Specification

The following error codes MAY appear as a value for `code` in an entry in the `errors` array sent with any message:

- `NOT_FOUND`: the message relied on an entity that was not found
- `FORBIDDEN`: the message relied on permissions that the user or block does not have
- `INVALID_INPUT`: the message relied on previous input that was missing or otherwise invalid

Individual messages MAY specify only a subset of these codes as being valid for that message.

### Message definitions

#### <Hidden>Message definitions </Hidden>Summary

Messages under the graph module can be grouped into two functional categories:

- **values** provided by the embedding application, marked as `source: "embedder"` and `sentOnInitialization: true`
- **requests** made by the block during its lifetime, marked as `source: "block"`

Note that there is no reason why embedding applications cannot make requests, nor why blocks cannot send values on initialization, but the module does yet not specify any such messages.

The **values** are all sent from the embedding application to the block on initialization, and re-sent subsequently if they change. They are:

- `blockEntitySubgraph`: the subgraph rooted at the block entity, resolved to a depth determined by the embedding application
- `readonly`: whether or not the block should display in ‘readonly’ mode, disabling or hiding any editing controls it offers.

The **requests** may be made by the block once it has been initialized, and represent operations which create, read, update or delete entities. They are named according to the pattern `[action][Resource]`, e.g. `createEntity`.

As well as the formal module JSON specification, the messages can be sent and received via the `@blockprotocol/graph` [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockprotocol/graph).

#### <Hidden>Message definitions </Hidden>Specification

The messages available for exchange in the graph module are defined in the [module's JSON definition](https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/blob/main/libs/%40blockprotocol/graph/src/graph-module.json#L5) and are also
listed below for ease of reference.
