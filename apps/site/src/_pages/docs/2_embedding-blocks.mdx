# Embedding Blocks

Apps and frameworks can allow their users to insert Þ blocks themselves by becoming an "embedder".

## Instructions for embedders

We're still determining how best to support potential embedders. Until we have public documentation written up and on this page:

1.  If you're interested in supporting the Block Protocol within your application now, allowing your users to insert and use blocks from the [Þ Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), please [contact us](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) with more information about your intended use, and we'll be in touch.
1.  If you'd prefer to get updated when our docs are generally available, please [register for updates](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) on the website instead.

## Instructions for users

If you're looking to _use_ Block Protocol blocks on your website, or in another app, please see our page on [using blocks](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/using-blocks).
