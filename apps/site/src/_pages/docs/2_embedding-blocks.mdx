# Embedding Blocks

Apps and frameworks can allow their users to insert Þ blocks themselves by becoming an "embedder".

## Instructions for embedders

We're still in the process of writing up docs that will outline the Þ integration process for embedders.

- If you're interested in embedding blocks within your application now, please [contact us](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) directly with more information about your intended use, and we'll be in touch.
- If you'd prefer to register for future updates, please [sign up on the website](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) instead.
