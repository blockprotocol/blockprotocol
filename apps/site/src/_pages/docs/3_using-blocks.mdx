# Using Blocks

Block Protocol blocks are available in a number of embedding environments.

## Now available

### HASH

HASH is a block-based knowledge management, business intelligence and tool-building application.

- The hosted version of HASH is [available for early access](https://hash.ai) and is in alpha
- HASH is open source, and its code can be downloaded from the [`hashintel/hash` GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashintel/hash)

### WordPress

The [Block Protocol for Wordpress](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress) plugin adds support for Ãž blocks within the existing WordPress Gutenberg editor. It is currently available for [early access testing](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress), and will become generally available at the end of February 2023 alongside version 0.3 of the Block Protocol specification.

## Coming soon

### GitHub Blocks

**We are in the early stages of building out support for Block Protocol blocks in _GitHub_.** Blocks are currently only available in GitHub as part of the _GitHub Next_ early release program, but ultimately this should allow blocks you develop in accordance with the Block Protocol spec to be used within GitHub markdown READMEs interactively, and elsewhere on _GitHub.com_.

### Figma

**We are planning support for Block Protocol blocks in both _Figma_ and _Figjam_.** Development has not yet begun. If you are interested in getting involved, please let us know on [our Discord](https://blockprotocol.org/discord).

### Other environments

Support for additional embedding environments will arrive throughout 2023.

If you're looking to implement support for the Block Protocol in another application or framework that you'd like to see mentioned here, read more about [embedding blocks](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/embedding-blocks) and feel free to [reach out](https://blockprotocol.org/contact) to us.
