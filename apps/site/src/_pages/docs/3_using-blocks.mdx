# Using Blocks

Block Protocol blocks are available in a number of embedding environments.

## HASH

[HASH](https://hash.ai) is a block-based knowledge management, business intelligence and tool-building application. The hosted app is currently in private beta, and a publicly available version can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/hashintel/hash) to self-host.

## WordPress

The [Block Protocol for Wordpress](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress) plugin adds support for Ãž blocks within the existing WordPress Gutenberg editor. It is currently available for [early access testing](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress), and will become generally available in February 2023 alongside version 0.3 of the Block Protocol specification.

## Other environments

If you're implementing support for the Block Protocol in another application or framework that you'd like to see mentioned here, please feel free to [reach out](https://blockprotocol.org/contact).
