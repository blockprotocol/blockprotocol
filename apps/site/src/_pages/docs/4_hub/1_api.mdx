# API

The Block Protocol (**Þ**) API is used exclusively to interface with the Þ Hub.

This allows for users to programmatically both **query** and **use** blocks, types and services, as well as securely **authenticate** themselves with external services.

## About API Keys

### Obtaining a key

To use the Þ API, you must first [register for an account](https://blockprotocol.org/signup).

Once [logged in](https://blockprotocol.org/login), navigate to the [Account > API Keys](https://blockprotocol.org/account/api) page to create a new key.

### How keys work

Þ API keys can be attached to any programmatic request to access the Þ Hub, and serve as a means of authenticating your identity. As such, your full API key should be kept secret, like a password. Anybody with access to your full key can effectively access your account.

Þ API keys look something like this: `b10ck5.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY`

They are split into three parts:

1.  the 'protocol identifier' (`b10ck5`), which is the same for all API keys.
2.  the 'public portion' of your key (`X` above, which contains 32 characters). You can think of this as your 'username', which doesn't necessarily need to remain secret.
3.  the 'private portion' of your key (`Y` above, which contains 36 characters). This is essentially your 'password', and it should remain secret and known only to you at all times.

If you believe the private portion of your key has become known to any unauthorized party, or has accidentally been made public (for example included in a code snippet uploaded to a website like GitHub) you should immediately revoke your key. You can revoke a key from the [Account > API Keys](https://blockprotocol.org/account/api) page.

Once an API key has been generated, it cannot be redisplayed. As such, you should consider generating a new key whenever you require one, or storing keys securely in an encrypted password manager upon generation.

### Using your key

#### To connect existing applications

Most Block Protocol users will only ever generate a key for the purpose of connecting another application to the Block Protocol. For example, a user of the [Block Protocol for WordPress](https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress) might generate a key to enable access to the Block Protocol on their website.

#### To develop new applications

_Full API documentation will be published soon._

##### Searching for blocks

The `/api/blocks` route allows you to list and filter blocks.

For example, to retrieve a list of all blocks:

```javascript
fetch("https://blockprotocol.org/api/blocks", {
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
})
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

The following query parameters are available. All are optional, and may be combined to narrow results by a combination of filters:

- `author`: search for blocks with a matching author.
- `license`: search for blocks with a matching license.
- `name`: search for blocks with a matching name.
- `q`: search for blocks with a matching name or author.
