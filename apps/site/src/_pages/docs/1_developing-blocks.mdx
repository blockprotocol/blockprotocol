# Developing Blocks

## Introduction

Blocks are discrete components that allow users to view, explore, or edit data.

The Block Protocol defines a standard for communication between blocks and the applications that embed them.

The protocol is split into a core specification setting out _how_ applications and blocks communicate, and module specifications defining _what_ applications and blocks communicate.

This guide helps get you set up and introduces some of the key features of the graph module specification, which deals with creating, reading and updating data records (or “entities”).

In practice, most block developers will not need to know the lower-level details of the specifications, as the libraries we provide implement them.

## Creating a block

1.  Move to a folder where you want to create your block.
1.  Run `npx create-block-app@latest your-block-name`.
1.  Switch to your new folder: `cd [your-block-name]`.
1.  Run `yarn install && yarn dev` or `npm install && npm run dev`.
1.  Open [http://localhost:63212](http://localhost:63212/) in your browser to see the starter template.


### I want to use a different technology

If you want to write blocks **using other technologies or frameworks**, we provide three templates to choose from which allow you to define the entry point for your block in different ways. To change the template, pass a parameter to the above command as follows: `npx create-block-app@latest your-block-name --template <TEMPLATE>`. 

Currently the three templates are:

1.  `react` - the default template which uses React and has a suite of helpful hooks you can use.
1.  `custom-element` - create a block defined as a custom element (also known as Web Components), which is based on [Lit](https://lit.dev/). You can also use different approaches when constructing the element-i.e. use a custom element as a wrapper for anything else you like.
1.  `html` - give up some of the ecosystem to roll-your-own, import and use additional libraries inside the `<script>` tag.

You may also use any other language which can be transpiled to JavaScript. As an example, see [this blog post](https://hash.dev/blog/build-blocks-in-any-language) on writing a block using F#. This block uses React – you can use transpiled JavaScript in blocks defined as HTML files or custom elements too.

The sections below assume that you're using the `react` template.

### I don’t want to use TypeScript

You can write your block in regular JavaScript using the methods described above - just rename your files from `*.tsx/*.ts` to `*.jsx/*.js`, remove the types, and get coding.

## The development environment

The `create-block-app` package and provides everything you need to develop a block.

- `src/app.tsx` or `src/app.ts` contains your block’s code.
  - You can include dependencies in your block but bear in mind that the more dependencies you add, the bigger your block’s download size will be. Common dependencies which you can reasonably expect an embedding application to provide (e.g. React) can be defined as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`.
- `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` will run your block in development mode, serving it locally with hot reloading at [http://localhost:63212](http://localhost:63212).
  - This uses the file at `src/dev.tsx` to render your block within a mock embedding application called `MockBlockDock`.
  - By default, dev mode will also show you the properties that are being passed to your block and the contents of the mock datastore. Remove `debug` from `MockBlockDock` to turn this off, or toggle it via the provided switch in the UI.
- `yarn build` or `npm run build` will:
  - Bundle the component into a single source file (without any dependencies listed as `peerDependencies`).
  - Generate a `block-metadata.json` file which:
    - points to the bundled `source` file.
    - brings in metadata from `package.json`, such as the description.
    - brings in anything in the `blockprotocol` object in `package.json`, e.g.
      - `blockType`: the type of block this is.
      - `displayName`: a friendly display name
      - `examples`: an array of example data structures your block would accept and use
      - `image`: a preview image showing your block in action (in place of `public/block-preview.png`)
      - `icon`: an icon to be associated with your block (in place of `public/omega.svg`)
      - `name`: a slugified name for your block (which may differ to the package `name` in package.json); it can be defined as `blockname` or `@namespace/blockname`, where `namespace` must be your username on blockprotocol.org if you intend to publish it there
    - list the `externals`, which are generated from `peerDependencies` in package.json.

### Updating the block schema

A key part of the Block Protocol is the use of types to describe the data your block will work with.

Your block should be associated with an “entity type” which will be used by embedding applications
to understand what sorts of entities can be sent to it (e.g. what properties do they have?).

When an embedding application loads your block, it should send an entity which complies with the structure of the block's
declared entity type. We call such an entity the 'block entity'.

See [working with types](/docs/working-with-types) for more information on the type system, or jump straight to
[your dashboard](/dashboard) to create a type.

Once you have created the type representing the data your block needs, copy its URL, and update the `schema` property
in the `blockprotocol` object in `package.json`. In TypeScript block templates, you can then run `yarn schema` to
regenerate the types for your block.

## Lifecycle of a block

When a block is loaded into an embedding application:

The embedding application parses its `block-metadata.json` file and:

- provides any external dependencies which the block needs.
- sets up message handling as described in the core specification.
- loads the block with the appropriate strategy for its `blockType`.

The block then receives any data which the embedder can provide straight away,
for example as part of [the graph module](#using-the-graph-module):

- `custom-element` and `react`-type blocks will be sent initial data as properties/props.
- `html`-type blocks will be sent messages containing the initial data.
- the block can then do whatever it chooses to do with those properties.

At any time after this initialization, the block may send further messages via a `Module` for specific purposes,
such as reading and writing data within the embedding application.

The starter blocks created by `create-block-app` implement a simple example of this:

1.  the `Thing` entity type referred to in `blockprotocol.schema` in `package.json`, for which types are found in `src/types.gen.ts`,
    defines the properties expected for the block entity.
1.  mock values for the block entity are passed to `MockBlockDock` in `dev.tsx`, including the `properties` it expects
1.  the block receives the data for `blockEntitySubgraph` ([described below](#using-the-graph-module)):

- the `react` and `custom-element` blocks extract the block entity from the `blockEntitySubgraph`
- the `html` block registers a callback for the `blockEntitySubgraph` message.
- each block then accesses the properties from the block entity and uses the name property to render its `Hello, World!` message.

## Using the Graph Module

The Graph Module describes how entities can be created, queried, updated, and linked together, including the block entity. It enables your block to create, read, update, and delete data in the embedding application.

The Graph Module is available via the `graphModule` property in each starter template. It has a number of methods corresponding to the messages defined in the [specification](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/graph-module).

Using these methods in combination, you can create complex graphs from within a block without having to know anything about the implementation details of the application embedding it.

Each message payload is the same: an object containing `data` and `errors` keys.

### The `graph` properties object

The `graph` properties object is sent in `properties`/`props` for `custom-element` and `react`-type blocks, and as a message
for `html`-type blocks.

It contains data sent from the embedding application to the block related to the graph module. Importantly:

- `readonly`: a boolean indicating whether the block is in a read-only context. This typically means that the embedding application
  will reject any requests to update data, and the block should alter its UI and behaviour accordingly.

- `blockEntitySubgraph`: this contains the 'block entity' and any entities immediately linked to it. It is a _graph_ of entities
  _rooted_ at the block entity.

We provide helper tools for extracting the key information from `blockEntitySubgraph`:

- in the `react` template, a `useEntitySubgraph` hook can return the `rootEntity` (the block entity) and any `linkedEntities`
- in the `custom-element` template, `this.getBlockEntity()` and `this.getLinkedEntities()` are available
- in the `html` template (and everywhere), you can use functions available in `@blockprotocol/graph/stdlib`, for example:
  - `getRoots` to get the roots from a subgraph (for a `blockEntitySubgraph`, there should only be one)
  - `getOutgoingLinkAndTargetEntities` to get the entities _linked from_ a given entity (the 'target' entities), and the links themselves
    (N.B this is equivalent to `linkedEntities` in the other templates, which are for outgoing links from the block entity onl)
  - `getIncomingLinkAndTargetEntities` to get the entities _linking to_ a given entity, and the links

Many of the messages sent from the application to the block as part of the graph module return a `Subgraph`.
You shouldn't have to worry about the internal workings of a `Subgraph`, but it is worth knowing that a given subgraph
represents the result of a query starting with a given entity (or entities) and following links from it to other entities.
The links are also entities (they may have properties and relationships of their own), known as 'link entities'.

The four components of a `Subgraph` are:

- `roots`: the entities which were the starting point of the query (e.g. only the 'block entity' in the case of `blockEntitySubgraph`)
- `depths`: which `edges` were followed from the `roots` when resolving the query, and how far
- `edges`: connections between things in the graph. For example, a 'link entity' connects it and two other entities via `hasRightEntity`
  and `hasLeftEntity` edges (conceptually, the link entity is in the middle with an entity on its left and on its right)
- `vertices`: each element of the graph which was encountered when starting from the roots and following the specified `edges`
  to the specified `depths`.

Again, you **probably don't need to worry about this when getting started** – but if you start to work with complex data networks
made up of many entities with different relationships, the `Subgraph` and knowing how to query it becomes a powerful tool.

### Updating the block entity

A common use for the Graph Module is to update the block entity – to update the properties that are sent to the block.

Each block template includes a demonstration of calling `graphModule.updateEntity` to update the block entity.

To do this, you need to call `updateEntity` using the `entityId` of the `blockEntity`:

```js
// Update the block entity, and receive the updated entity in return
const { data, errors } = await graphModule.updateEntity({
  data: {
    entityId: blockEntity.metadata.recordId.entityId,
    entityTypeId: blockEntity.metadata.entityTypeId,
    properties: {
      "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/name/":
        "Bob",
    },
  },
});
```

How you get a reference to `blockEntity` depends on the type of block, as described above and demonstrated in each template.

As soon as the `updateEntity` call is processed, for `react` and `custom-element` blocks your block will be re-rendered with
the updated properties. You could therefore omit the `{ data, errors }` from the above snippet and rely on the updated properties
when the block is re-rendered.

If you’re using the `custom-element` template, you have a helper method to achieve the above:

```js
this.updateSelfProperties({
  "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/name/": "Bob",
});
```

Because properties are identified by URLs, you may wish to alias them in your code if used in multiple places. For example:

```js
const nameKey =
  "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/property-type/name/";

if (blockEntity.properties[nameKey] !== "Bob") {
  await graphModule.updateEntity({
    data: {
      entityId: blockEntity.metadata.recordId.entityId,
      entityTypeId: blockEntity.metadata.entityTypeId,
      properties: { [nameKey]: "Bob" },
    },
  });
}
```

You can read more about how types are described on the [working with types](/docs/working-with-types) page.

### Creating new entities

You can create new entities using the `createEntity` method.

New entities should be assigned starting `properties` and an `entityTypeId` (a URL pointing to their entity type).

### Linking entities together

Because links between entities are just a special kind of entity, you call `createEntity` to create them,
specifying additional `linkData` to indicate which entities are on the 'left' and 'right' of the link.
For now you can think of the 'left' entity as the source of the link, and the 'right' entity as the target or destination.

For example, to link an entity to the block entity:

```js
// link the 'blockEntity' to some 'otherEntity' you have a reference to (e.g. if you have newly created it)
graphModule.createEntity({
  data: {
    entityTypeId:
      "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/entity-type/friend/v/1",
    linkData: {
      leftEntity: blockEntity.metadata.recordId.entityId,
      destinationEntityId: otherEntity.metadata.recordId.entityId,
    },
    properties: {}, // this can contain metadata about the link, if you wish
  },
});
```

You can define the type of relationships between your block entity and other entities when [defining its type](/docs/working-with-types),
and the `entityTypeId` of the relevant relationship will then be available in the generated types (after running `yarn schema`)/

Any entities linked directly from the block will appear in the `blockEntitySubgraph` property.

You can also link other entities together, but whether or not they appear in `blockEntitySubgraph` will depend on
whether they are connected to the block entity at all, and far away they are (what `depths` are required to reach them).

### Exploring the data store

There are messages for exploring the data available in the embedding application:

#### Retrieving the subgraph rooted at a specific entity

If you know of a specific entity that you want to retrieve more detailed information on, you can call `getEntity` with its `entityId`.
When doing this, you can provide how much of the graph you want to explore around the entity, by providing `graphResolveDepths`.

For example, to retrieve the subgraph rooted at the entity, with its links and their destinations:

```js
const getEntityResponse = await graphModule.getEntity({
  data: {
    entityId: someEntityId,
    graphResolveDepths: {
      hasLeftEntity: {
        incoming: 1,
        outgoing: 0,
      },
      hasRightEntity: {
        incoming: 0,
        outgoing: 1,
      },
    },
  },
});

if (getEntityResponse.errors) {
  // handle errors
}

const { data: entitySubgraph } = getEntityResponse;
```

Here `graphResolveDepths` specifies two edge kinds,

- `hasLeftEntity` - the edge that appears between a link entity and its left entity (which can be thought of as the 'source' of the link)
- `hasRightEntity` - the edge that appears between a link entity and its right entity (which can be thought of as the 'destination' of the link)

The process of exploring a graph is known as 'traversal'. This involves visiting a vertex (an element in the graph – in our case, an entity), and then following edges from it (connections to other vertices) based on the parameters of the query. The parameters specify which kinds of edges to follow, and how many times they should be followed for any given journey through the graph. Each vertex visited might have multiple edges that can be followed from it, which means that each query actually involves many different journeys through the graph, which we refer to as 'branches' of the traversal.

For each edge kind, we specify the `incoming` and `outgoing` depths to resolve, where:

- for `hasLeftEntity`
  - `outgoing` means there is an outgoing edge _from_ the left entity _to_ the link entity, and defines the number of times to explore the left entity of link entities in a given branch of traversal.
  - `incoming` means there is an incoming edge _from_ the link entity _to_ the left entity, which can be thought of as an "outgoing link entity" to the entity being traversed. The depth defines the number of times to explore outgoing link entities of entities in a given branch of traversal.
- for `hasRightEntity`
  - `outgoing` means there is an outgoing edge _from_ the right entity _to_ the link entity, and defines the number of times to explore the right entity of link entities in a given branch of traversal.
  - `incoming` means there is an incoming edge _from_ the link entity _to_ the right entity, which can be thought of as an "incoming link entity" to the entity being traversed. The depth defines the number of times to explore incoming link entities of entities in a given branch of traversal.

Therefore, the parameters in the example mean:

- `(hasLeftEntity, incoming, 1)` - explore outgoing link entities to a depth of 1
- `(hasLeftEntity, outgoing, 0)` - do not explore the left entity of link entities
- `(hasRightEntity, incoming, 0)` - do not explore incoming link entities
- `(hasRightEntity, outgoing, 1)` - explore the right entity of link entities to a depth of 1

#### Filtering the data store

However, it's also possible to query across all entities in the datastore.
The `queryEntities` message allows you submit a query with a filter.
You can use this to browse the available entities in order to display them, or create links between them.

##### Example: Filtering entities by property value

To retrieve the subgraph rooted at all entities with a property `https://blockprotocol.org/types/@blockprotocol/property-type/name/` with a value of `"Alice"` or `"Bob"`:

```js
const nameIsFilter = (value) => ({
  field: [
    "properties",
    "https://blockprotocol.org/types/@blockprotocol/property-type/name/",
  ],
  operator: "EQUALS",
  value,
});

const queryEntitiesResponse = await graphModule.queryEntities({
  data: {
    operation: {
      multiFilter: {
        filters: [nameIsFilter("Alice"), nameIsFilter("Bob")],
        operator: "OR",
      },
    },
  },
});

if (queryEntitiesResponse.errors) {
  // handle errors
}

const { data: subgraph } = queryEntitiesResponse;

const entities = getRoots(subgraph);
```

Here we use the `getRoots` method from `@blockprotocol/graph/stdlib` to retrieve the entities at the roots of the subgraph.

##### Example: Filtering entities by entity type

To retrieve the subgraph rooted at all entities with an entity type with base URL `https://blockprotocol.org/types/@blockprotocol/entity-type/person/`:

```js
const entityTypeBaseUrlEqualsFilter = (value) => ({
  field: ["metadata", "entityTypeId"],
  operator: "EQUALS",
  value,
});

const queryEntitiesResponse = await graphModule.queryEntities({
  data: {
    operation: {
      multiFilter: {
        filters: [
          entityTypeBaseUrlEqualsFilter(
            "https://blockprotocol.org/types/@blockprotocol/entity-type/person/",
          ),
        ],
        operator: "AND",
      },
    },
  },
});

if (queryEntitiesResponse.errors) {
  // handle errors
}

const { data: subgraph } = queryEntitiesResponse;

const entities = getRoots(subgraph);
```

##### Customizing the query

Note, that we could have provided a `graphResolveDepths` parameter similar to the `getEntity` query example above, but have opted to not do so here which will default to a depth of 0 for all edge kinds, so the `Subgraph` will only return the roots.

More information on building filters can be found within the documentation of the [`queryEntities` message in the specification](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/graph-module#message:queryEntities).

### Going further with the graph module

If you are using TypeScript, the types for methods available on `graphModule` (as defined in the `@blockprotocol/graph` package) should help you understand what methods are available and how they operate.

## Build

Once you’ve finished writing your block, run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

This will produce a compiled version of your code in the `dist` folder, along with a metadata file describing your block (`block-metadata.json`).

It is worth updating the `blockprotocol` object in `package.json` to include your own `icon`, `image`, and `examples` for your block. These will automatically be included in the `block-metadata.json` produced after running `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

You now have a block package that you can provide to apps to use, by **publishing it on the Hub**.

## Publish

Once you've built a block, you can add it to the [Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), so that your block will have an instant online demo playground,
and will be searchable via our block API.

To publish a block on the Hub take the following steps.

### Pre-requisite: obtain an API Key

- If you don't yet already have an account, click the [sign up](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) button in the top-right corner of any page on the Þ website.
- Once signed in, [create an API key](https://blockprotocol.org/settings/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.

### Publish from your terminal

- Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production build of your block (it will appear in the `dist` folder)
- run `npx blockprotocol@latest publish` to generate a `.blockprotocolrc` file when prompted
- Replace the placeholder key in that file with your API key
- now run `npx blockprotocol@latest publish` again
- See your block on the Hub!

### Updating your block

You can update your published block at any time by running
`npm run build && npx blockprotocol@latest publish` or `yarn build && npx blockprotocol@latest publish`

### Have your block verified

In order to have your block enter the queue to be reviewed for verification status, please ensure the `repository`
field in your `package.json` points to a public repository containing your code, and add a `commit` field to the
`blockprotocol` object within `package.json` that specifies the commit hash the version you are publishing was built from.

Read more about verification in [the FAQ](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/faq#how-does-block-verification-work).

### Changing the Hub preview

- Take a screenshot of your block in action and replace `public/block-preview.png`
- update the `description` in package.json
- add an icon to the `public` folder and update `blockprotocol.icon` in `package.json`
- add a preview `image` to the `public` folder and update `blockprotocol.image` in `package.json`
- update your block’s `README.md` – it will appear below your block on its hub page if you change it from the default
- update the example properties object in `blockprotocol.examples` in `package.json`
