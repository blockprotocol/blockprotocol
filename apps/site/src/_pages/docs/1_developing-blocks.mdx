# Developing Blocks

## Introduction

Blocks are discrete components that allow users to view, explore, or edit data.

The Block Protocol defines a standard for communication between blocks and the applications that embed them.

The protocol is split into a core specification setting out _how_ applications and blocks communicate, and service specifications defining _what_ applications and blocks communicate.

This guide helps get you set up and introduces some of the key features of the graph service specification, which deals with creating, reading and updating data records (or “entities”).

In practice, most block developers will not need to know the lower-level details of the specifications, as the libraries we provide implement them.

## Choosing your approach

We provide three templates which allow you to define the entry point for your block in different ways:

- `custom-element`: create a block defined as a custom element (also known as Web Components).
- `html`: create a block defined as an HTML file, with JavaScript added via `<script>` tags.
- `react`: create a block defined as a React component.

To create a new block, run `npx create-block-app@latest block-name --template template`, replacing `block-name` with the name to give your block, and `template` with one of the template names listed above.

### I want to use a different technology

If you want to write blocks **using other technologies or frameworks**, you have several options:

1.  use a `custom-element` template and use different approaches when constructing the element-i.e. use a custom element as a wrapper for anything else you like.
1.  use an `html` template and import and use your additional libraries inside the `<script>` tag.
1.  use a language which can be transpiled to JavaScript. As an example, see [this blog post](https://hash.dev/blog/build-blocks-in-any-language) on writing a block using F#. This block uses React, you can use transpiled JavaScript in blocks defined as HTML files or custom elements too.

### I don’t want to use TypeScript

You can write your block in regular JavaScript using the methods described above - just rename your files from `*.tsx/*.ts` to `*.jsx/*.js`, remove the types, and get coding.

Bear in mind that a block schema will not be automatically generated as part of the build process – you can write your own `block-schema.json` file at the root of your block’s folder, giving the type of props your App component accepts in [JSON Schema format](https://json-schema.org/).

## Creating a block

1.  Move to a folder where you want to create your block.
1.  Run `npx create-block-app@latest your-block-name --template template`.
1.  Switch to your new folder: `cd [your-block-name]`.
1.  Run `yarn install && yarn dev` or `npm install && npm run dev`.
1.  Open [http://localhost:63212](http://localhost:63212/) in your browser to see your block.

## The development environment

The `create-block-app` package provides everything you need to develop a block.

- `src/app.tsx` or `src/app.ts` contains your block’s code.
  - You can include dependencies in your block but bear in mind that the more dependencies you add, the bigger your block’s download size will be. Common dependencies which you can reasonably expect an embedding application to provide (e.g. React) can be defined as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`.
- `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` will run your block in development mode, serving it locally with hot reloading at [http://localhost:63212](http://localhost:63212).
  - This uses the file at `src/dev.tsx` to render your block within a mock embedding application called `MockBlockDock`.
  - By default, dev mode will also show you the properties that are being passed to your block and the contents of the mock datastore. Remove `debug` from `MockBlockDock` to turn this off.
- `yarn build` or `npm run build` will:
  - Bundle the component into a single source file (without any dependencies listed as `peerDependencies`).
  - Generate a JSON schema from the `BlockEntityProperties` type representing the data interface with the block. If your block folder contains `block-schema.json`, this custom schema will be used instead.
  - Generate a `block-metadata.json` file which:
    - points to the `schema` and `source` files.
    - brings in metadata from `package.json`, such as the block name and description.
    - brings in anything in the `blockprotocol` object in `package.json`, e.g.
      - `blockType`: the type of block this is.
      - `displayName`: a friendly display name.
      - `examples`: an array of example data structures your block would accept and use.
      - `image`: a preview image showing your block in action.
      - `icon`: an icon to be associated with your block.
    - list the `externals`, which are generated from `peerDependencies` in package.json.

## Lifecycle of a block

When a block is loaded into an embedding application:

1.  the embedding application parses its `block-metadata.json` file and:
1.  provides any external dependencies which the block needs.
1.  sets up message handling as described in the core specification.
1.  loads the block with the appropriate strategy for its `blockType`.
1.  the block then receives any data which the embedder can provide straight away:
1.  `custom-element` and `react`-type blocks will be sent this initial data as properties.
1.  `html`-type blocks will be sent messages containing the initial data.
1.  the block can then do whatever it chooses to do with those properties.
1.  at any time after this initialization, the block may send further messages via a `Service` for specific purposes, such as reading and writing data within the embedding application.

The starter blocks created by `create-block-app` implement a simple example of this lifecycle:

1.  the `BlockEntityProperties` type in `src/app.tsx` defines the properties expected for the `blockEntity` (part of [the Graph Service](#using-the-graph-service)).
1.  mock values for the `blockEntity` are passed to `MockBlockDock` in `dev.tsx`, including the `properties` it expects (in this case, a `name` of type `string`).
1.  the block receives the data for `blockEntity`:
1.  the `react` and `custom-element` blocks receive the `blockEntity` as part of the `graph` object in their properties.
1.  the `html` block registers a callback for the `blockEntity` message.
1.  the block accesses the properties in `blockEntity` and uses the `name` property to render its `Hello, World!` message.

## Using the Graph Service

The Graph Service describes how entities can be created, queried, updated, and linked together, including the block entity. It enables your block to create, read, update, and delete data in the embedding application.

The Graph Service is available via the `graphService` property in each starter template. It has a number of methods corresponding to the messages defined in the [specification](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/graph-service).

Using these methods in combination, you can create complex graphs from within a block without having to know anything about the implementation details of the application embedding it.

Each message payload is the same: an object containing `data` and `errors` keys.

Depending on the template, you may need to check that the `graphService` is available before using it (we will be removing the need for this shortly). These checks are omitted below.

### Updating the `blockEntity`

A common use for the Graph Service is to update the `blockEntity` to update the properties that are sent to the block (including when it is loaded again in the future).

To do this, you need to call `updateEntity` using the `entityId` of the `blockEntity`:

```js
// Update the block entity, and receive the updated entity in return
const { data, errors } = await graphService.updateEntity({
  data: {
    entityId: blockEntity.entityId,
    properties: { name: "Bob" },
  },
});
```

You can get the `blockEntity` from properties for `custom-element` and `react`-type blocks, and from a message callback for `html`-type blocks. There are examples in the templates.

As soon as the `updateEntity` call is processed, your block will be re-rendered with the updated properties, or in the case of `html` blocks, the `blockEntity` message re-sent with the updated data. You could therefore omit the `{ data, errors }` from the above snippet and rely on the updated properties or message.

If you’re using the `custom-element` template, you have a helper method to achieve the above:

```js
this.updateSelfProperties({ name: "Bob" });
```

### Exploring the data store

There are messages for exploring the data available in the embedding application:

- `aggregateEntities` allows you to request a list of available entities.
- `aggregateEntityTypes` allows you to request a list of available entity *types-*entities typically belong to a type, which describes their expected structure.

You can browse the available entities and types in order to display them, or create links between them.

### Linking entities to the `blockEntity`

To link other entities to the block, call `createLink` with the relevant source and destination:

```js
graphService?.createLink({
  data: {
    sourceEntityId: blockEntity.entityId,
    destinationEntityId: "person-1",
    path: "friend",
  },
});
```

Any entities linked to the block will appear in the `linkedEntities` property, with the links themselves appearing in `linkGroups`. You can also link other arbitrary entities together.

### Going further

If you are using TypeScript, the types for methods available on `graphService` (as defined in the `@blockprotocol/graph` package) should help you understand what methods are available and how they operate.

You can also review the messages defined in the graph specification [here](https://blockprotocol.org/docs/spec/graph-service). If you do so, bear in mind the following:

- only the ones marked as `source: "block"` are available as methods to your block.
- any message marked as `sentOnInitialization` with `source: "embeder"` will be passed to your block as soon as it’s loaded. Remember that `custom-element` and `react`-type blocks receive these messages as properties under a `graph` object, whereas `html` blocks can register callbacks for each message.
- if a message has `respondedToBy`, it expects a response and the `graphService` method will return a Promise which will resolve with the `{ data, errors }` object. If a message does not expect a response, the method will return void.

## Testing your block in HASH

[HASH](https://hash.ai) is an open-source, data-centric, all-in-one workspace built atop the Block Protocol. While it is not yet ready for production use, you can use it to test your block in a real embedding application with example data.

To load your block into HASH:

1.  Visit the [HASH repo](https://github.com/hashintel/hash/tree/main/apps/hash) and follow the instructions to run HASH locally.
1.  In your block’s directory, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. This will serve your block locally at a localhost URL in development mode and will reload if you make changes to your source code. Alternatively, you can run `yarn build && yarn serve` to test a production build of your block which will not automatically rebuild if you make changes to the source code.
1.  Copy that localhost URL to your clipboard.
1.  In HASH, create or navigate to a Page.
1.  Find the […] menu button on the left of a block in the Page (you should see this button under the title on a new page).
1.  Open that menu and paste the block’s localhost URL into the “Load block from URL…” input field and click "Load block".

If you’re running your block in dev mode (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`) and you make changes to the source code, your block will rebuild and HASH should automatically refresh the page. If you’re running your block in production mode, you will need to run `yarn build` from your block folder and reload your block manually in HASH by repeating steps 5-6 again.

## Build

Once you’ve finished writing your block, run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

This will produce a compiled version of your code in the `dist` folder, along with metadata files describing your block (`block-metadata.json`), and the data it accepts (`block-schema.json`).

It is worth updating the `blockprotocol` object in `package.json` to include your own `icon`, `image`, and `examples` for your block. These will automatically be included in the `block-metadata.json` produced after running `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

You now have a block package that you can provide to apps to use, by **publishing it on the Hub**.

## Publish

Once you've built a block, you can add it to the [Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub), so that your block will have an instant online demo playground,
and will be searchable via our block API.

To publish a block on the Hub take the following steps.

### Pre-requisite: obtain an API Key

- If you don't yet already have an account, click the [sign up](https://blockprotocol.org/signup) button in the top-right corner of any page on the Þ website.
- Once signed in, [create an API key](https://blockprotocol.org/settings/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.

### Publish from your terminal

- Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production build of your block (it will appear in the `dist` folder)
- run `npx blockprotocol@latest publish` to generate a `.blockprotocolrc` file when prompted
- Replace the placeholder key in that file with your API key
- now run `npx blockprotocol@latest publish` again
- See your block on the Hub!

### Updating your block

You can update your published block at any time by running
`npm run build && npx blockprotocol@latest publish` or `yarn build && npx blockprotocol@latest publish`

### Changing the Hub preview

- Take a screenshot of your block in action and replace `public/block-preview.png`
- update the `description` in package.json
- add an icon to the `public` folder and update `blockprotocol.icon` in `package.json`
- update your block’s `README.md` – it will appear below your block on its hub page
- update the example object in `blockprotocol.examples` in `package.json`
