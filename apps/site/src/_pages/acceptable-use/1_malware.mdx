The Block Protocol considers the [Block Protocol Hub](/hub) to be a platform used primarily for installation and run-time use of code, and not for research.

Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform in direct support of unlawful attacks that cause technical harms, such as using the Block Protocol as a means to deliver malicious executables or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers. Technical harms means overconsumption of resources, physical damage, downtime, denial of service, or data loss.

We may restrict access to or remove any content we believe may be used to cause technical harms, or which is leveraging the Block Protocol platform as an exploit or malware delivery mechanism. We will normally contact the project owners about restrictions put in place.

Restrictions amy either be temporary, or permanent. If you believe your content may have been unduly restricted, we have an [appeals process](/legal/acceptable-use/appeals) in place.

To facilitate a path to abuse resolution with project maintainers themselves, prior to escalation to Block Protocol abuse reports, we recommend, but do not require, that project owners and block publishers take the following steps:

- Clearly identify and describe your work in a project `README` file or source code comments.
- Provide a preferred contact method for any 3rd party abuse inquiries through a `SECURITY` file in the repository. Such a contact method allows 3rd parties to reach out to project maintainers directly and potentially resolve concerns without the need to file abuse reports.
