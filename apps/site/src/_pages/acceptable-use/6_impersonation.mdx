You may not misrepresent your identity or your association with another person or organization. This includes doing any of the following in a way that misleads or deceives others:

- copying another user's avatar or other personal profile information;
- posting content under another user's email address;
- using a deceptively similar username, organization name, or other namespace; or
- otherwise posing as another individual or organization.

Impersonation is a form of [harassment](/legal/acceptable-use/harassment) and violation of this policy may lead to loss of access to your account.

Please note, having a username similar to another is not necessarily impersonation. The Block Protocol will take context into account. For example, as in cases involving claims of [misinformation or disinformation](/legal/acceptable-use/veracity), we generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our [Acceptable Use Polices](/legal/acceptable-use).
