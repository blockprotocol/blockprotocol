// This file was created in https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol/pull/609
// to fix path resolution in nyc reports. Without this file, paths are reported as
// site/x/y/z.js, but with this file, they need to be apps/site/x/y/z.js.
// We can remove this file after adding more apps or investigating the root cause.
