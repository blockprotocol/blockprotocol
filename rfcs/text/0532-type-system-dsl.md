# Summary

[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes a new system for expressing all types outlined in [RFC 0352],
and [RFC 0408] through a domain specific language (DSL).
The DSL addresses pain points that working with raw types using JSON brings with and
includes a toolbox of programs to aid in development, specifically geared towards
developers.

TODO: name? file extension?

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the protocol and you were teaching
it to another Block Protocol implementor. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Block Protocol implementors and users should _think_ about the feature,
  and how it should impact the way they use the protocol. It should explain the impact as
  concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration
  guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing and new Block
  Protocol users.

For implementation-oriented RFCs, this section should focus on how Block Protocol
implementors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For
policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and
explain its impact in concrete terms.

## Domain-Specific-Language (DSL)

### Primitive Types

```abnf
boolean = true / false
int = ["+" / "-"] 1*DIGIT
float = int "." 1*DIGIT
string = <single-quoted string> / <double-quoted string>
value = boolean / int / float / string
```

// TODO

### Composite Types

```abnf
list = "[" [ *(value ",") value [","] ] "]"
; Experimental
map = "{" [ *(IDENT "=" value ",") IDENT "=" value [","] ] "}"
```

// TODO

### Variables

```abnf
type = "@" / "#" / ">" / "~"
module = IDENT
version = int / "latest"

variable = [type] [module "::"] IDENT ["/" version]
```

Variables are used to reference to external and local resources, each type in the block
protocol has a specific prefix:

* `@` - property-type
* `#` - data-type
* `>` - link-type
* `~` - entity

The module refers to the use alias created for a repository of remote types, and can be
omitted, if omitted the module will default to `self`, which is the current repository.

The version is optional, and if not specified will default to the latest version, be
beware that this means that implementations may update every type when the mentioned type
was updated and the version wasn't pinned.

The type prefix is optional and is inferred to a concrete one depending on the context
used, this means `~> link` is equivalent to `~> >self::link`.

#### Inference Rules

* Link in entity: `~> link` inferred to `~> >self::link`
* Key of property: `prop "Prop" = { bp::a };` inferred to `prop "Prop" = { @bp::a };`
* Mention of reference in property: `prop "Prop" = [bp::number; ..5];` inferred
  to `prop "Prop" = [#bp::number; ..5];`
* Key of entity: `entity "Entity" = { a };` inferred to `entity "Entity" = { @self::a };`

#### Example 1

```
imp std;

prop age "Age" = #bp::number;
```

This means that the property `age` is of type `#bp::number` where `#` means it is a
data-type, `bp` is the synonym for `blockprotocol` in the `std` module, pointing to the
central repo, and `number` is a data-type that has been defined in that central repo.

### Reference

#### Use

```abnf
url = <http url>

use-key-value = id "=" string
use-with = "with" "{" [ *(use-key-value ",") use-key-value [","] ] "}"
use = "use" url "as" IDENT [use-with] ";"
```

The use statement is used to reference remote repositories with types. Implementations
must validate all types that have been referenced for a repository, except for `self`.

The `self` module/repository is special, it is the only repository that is required to
specify and is the repository an implementation will create the declared resources/types
in.

One can modify the paths generated for different resources using the `with {}` syntax,
where key-value pairs can be specified. There are four keys available: `prop`, `data`
, `link`, `entity`, with their value being a format string, which has 2 variables
available: `self` and `id`, `self` is the URL specified in the statement, while `id` is
the versioned id of the type/resource.

##### Example

```
use "https://blockprotocol.org/types/@alice" as self with {
    data = "{self}/data-type/{id}",
    prop = "{self}/property-type/{id}",
    link = "{self}/link-type/{id}",
    entity = "{self}/entity-type/{id}"
};
```

#### Reference

```abnf
range = [int] ".." ["="] [int]
reference-array = "[" variable [";" range] "]"
reference = variable / reference-array
```

References are used to refer to resources that have been declared locally (through `self`)
or exist in remote repositories, a reference can either be an array or a variable, in the
array, one can optionally specify a desired min and max length of the references needed.
The max in `min..max` is exclusive, while `min..=max` is inclusive to `max`, if `min`
isn't specified, it defaults to `0`, while `max` not being specified refers to no upper
bound.

* `0..5` = `..5` = `..=4` = `min: 0, max: 5`
* `1..3` = `1..=2` = `min: 1, max: 3`
* `..` = `0..` = `0..=` = `min: 0, max: unlimited`

### Resources

Resources are types, which are declared in the DSL. They have $n$ inputs and one output.

The inputs to a resource are implicitly defined, and are the resources that have been used
in the current resource. The output of a resource is its identifier.

You can only reference types for which you have explicitly defined an id.
Explicit identifiers for resources need to be unique across their type and namespace.

There are four types of resources:

* `prop` (corresponding to property-types)
* `link` (corresponding to link-types)
* `data` (corresponding to data-types)
* `entity` (corresponding to entities)

#### Example 1

```
imp std;

prop age "Age" = number;

prop alive "Boolean" = bool;

entity person "Person" = {
  age?,
  alive
};
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  bp_number["#bp::number"]
  bp_bool["#bp::boolean"]
  age[Age]
  alive[Alive]
  person[Person]
  
  bp_number --> number --> age
  bp_bool --> bool --> alive
  
  alive --> person
  age --> person
```

#### Example 2

```
entity person "Person" = {
  // ...
}

// This will fail
entity person "Person 2" = {
  // ...
}

// ----

entity "Human" = {
  // ...
}

// Implementation should warn (error in strict mode)
// but this would create two unique identifier on apply.
entity "Human" = {
  // ...
}


// ----

entity person "Person" = {
  // ... 
}

// This is ok, because the link person and entity person are completely different
// in namespace and type.
link person "Person";
```

#### Data Type

Currently unspecified

#### Property Type

```abnf
prop-object = "{" [ *(reference  ",") reference [","] ] "}"
prop-array = "[" prop-value [";" range] "]"
prop-value = variable / prop-object / prop-array 
prop-value /= prop-value "|" prop-value
prop-value /= "(" prop-value ")"

prop = "prop" [IDENT] title "=" prop-value ";"
```

// TODO: docs

#### Link Type

```abnf
link = "link" [IDENT] title ";"
```

// TODO: docs

#### Entity Type

```abnf
entity-link-direction = "~>" / "->"
entity-link = link-direction reference 
entity-item = reference / entity-link

entity-value = "{" [ *(entity-item ",") entity-item [","] ] "}"
entity = "entity" [IDENT] title "=" entity-value ";"
```

### Type Alias

```abnf
alias-prop = "alias" "prop" IDENT "=" prop-value ";"
alias-data = "alias" "data" IDENT ";" ; CURRENTLY UNDEFINED
alias-link = "alias" "link" IDENT ";" ; CURRENTLY UNDEFINED
alias-entity = "alias" "entity" IDENT ";" ; CURRENTLY UNDEFINED

alias = alias-prop / alias-entity / alias-data / alias-link
```

Type aliases are convenient ways to split the resource declaration (the right-hand side of
the `=`) into multiple parts, which can be documented and reused.
They use the same type prefix as a non-alias resource would and can be used
interchangeably.
Every occurrence of their identifier will be replaced with the declared value at
compilation time.

### Functions

This is an unstable feature. Everywhere where a value is used, one can also use a function
call to builtin functions. The DSL is unable to specify new functions and the
implementation must provide all functions.

Functions must be pure, due to the very nature, functions are evaluated at compile time
and can only succeed or panic (crash), instead of returning an error. Functions are
strongly typed and support union types.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is highly unstable, unimplemented and may be removed at any point.

```abnf
arg = call / variable / value
call = IDENT "(" [ *(arg ",") arg [","] ] ")"
```

| `floor(float) -> float`   | Floor a float                | Will never panic                    |

#### Conversion Table

| Input           | Function  | Result         |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| `bool`          | `toBool`  | `bool`         |
| `""`            | `toBool`  | `false`        |
| `string`        | `toBool`  | `true`         |
| `0`             | `toBool`  | `false`        |
| `int`           | `toBool`  | `true`         |
| `float`         | `toInt`   | `floor(float)` |
| string of int   | `toInt`   | `int`          |
| `true`          | `toInt`   | `1`            |
| `false`         | `toInt`   | `0`            |
| `int`           | `toFloat` | `int.0`        |
| string of float | `toFloat` | `float`        |
| `true`          | `toFloat` | `1.0`          |
| `false`         | `toFloat` | `0.0`          |

### Configuration

```abnf
set *(IDENT "::") IDENT "=" value ";"
```

Configuration is used to set values, which may be referenced later using interpolation or
during configuration of the implementations. Configuration keys need to be unique, cannot
be overwritten and user-defined configuration keys *may not* use built-in names.

Configuration keys are dictionaries, which are partitioned using `::`, this allows the
protection of certain values, to reduce breakage in future releases.

The namespace `impl` and `lang` are reserved and *may not* be used for user-defined
configuration.

`lang::unstable` and `impl::unstable` keys may be removed in any version but will only be
stabilized in major versions, before any feature is added, they are first added as an
unstable feature, and once matured will be stabilized.

### Modules

```abnf
path = *(IDENT "::") IDENT

import = "imp" path  ";"
```

Modules are files, which are either local or provided by the implemented (like `std`), the
path of a module is separated by `::`, if the path points to a directory, a file
named `mod.<INSERT SUFFIX HERE>` will be imported. An implementation **must** error if a
module couldn't be found.

Cycles of imports are not allowed, and there's no namespacing, identifiers for resources
need to be unique across all imported files.

Import resolution is done by analysing the imports of every file recursively, building a
tree of dependencies. These dependencies are then topologically sorted and concat together
to a single "virtual" file.

#### Example 1

##### Directory Structure

```
project
|  modA
|  |  modD.<INSERT SUFFIX HERE>
|  \- modE.<INSERT SUFFIX HERE>
|  modB
|   mod.<INSERT SUFFIX HERE>
\- modC.<INSERT SUFFIX HERE>
```

##### Code

```
imp modB; // This is valid
imp modA; // This will not compile as there's no `mod` file in the directory `modA`
imp modA::modD; // This is valid
imp modA::modE; // This is valid
```

#### Example 2

modA:

```
imp std;

// defines prop: A, B, C
```

modB:

```
imp std;
imp modA;

// defined prop: D, E, F
```

Module resolution graph:

```mermaid
flowchart BT;
  modA --> std
  
  modB --> std
  modB --> modA
```

Topologically sorted:

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
  std --> modA --> modB
```

#### `std` module

The std module is included in every implementation and should include the following code:

```
use "https://blockprotocol.org/types/@blockprotocol" as bp;

alias prop text = #bp::text;
alias prop number = #bp::number;
alias prop bool = #bp::boolean;
alias prop object = #bp::object;
```

The module provides sane defaults, like convenient aliases.

### Attributes

```abnf
attribute = "#" "[" IDENT "=" <tt> "]"
```

Attributes are optional information about a specific resource (property-type, data-type,
link-type, entity-type, etc.), which are used to add more detail to a resource.

Attribute values may refer to previously set configuration values, depending on the
attribute these may be forbidden.

| Name      | Description                                                                            | Type          | Variable Support |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| `version` | Version of a resource, if not specified will be inserted on execution, defaults to `1` | `int`         | `false`          |
| `cfg`     | Conditionally emit code, depending if the expr evaluates to true                       | meta language | `false`          |

[//]: # (TODO: should we include cfg or remove?!)

### Comments

```abnf
comment = "//" <string w/o leading '/', until EOF>
doc-comment = "///" <chars until EOF>
```

There are two types of comments: code comments and documentation comments.
Code comments are erased during the compilation, while documentation comments are used
as the description of resources (if they support it).
Code comments are allowed anywhere, while documentation comments are only allowed before
resources.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Developing, maintaining and creating a DSL is a challenging and a potentially
time-consuming effort; that might not pay off.
Drawbacks are that time will need to be allocated for the development and maintenance of
an implementation, as well as the possibility of users not adopting the language.

This proposal tries to mitigate these issues, by clearly defining the language first,
before implementing it, validating it with existing users and use-cases.

# Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This proposal tries to make the most concise declarative language possible for the DSL,
while trying to be extensible for future features.
The `unstable` configuration flag is here very important, it enables the language to add
new features, that might be removed in the future, without compromising the initial
version.

[HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) has been considered as an alternative language,
but to reduce the API surface, as well as gain more control a custom DSL was chosen.

Not doing this is completely fine, but will most probably hinder adoption by developers,
as the existing JSON is large, clumsy and due to the very nature of JSON quite redundant.

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

## Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)

The [Hashicorp Configuration Language](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) is a language
used at HashiCorp in their popular tools like [terraform](https:://terraform.io), it
provides a simpler and easier interface for configuration.
The community of HashiCorp has seen great success in the proliferation of the language and
is now used in all major products. It was inspired
by [libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl)
and [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure).

HCL was one of the major initial inspirations for this RFC.

## Rust

This proposal, especially the syntax of arrays, has been inspired
by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) a programming language, which has seen wide
adoption.

## Typescript

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a static type system, built on top of
Javascript is used worldwide and has seen wide adoption. It was the inspiration for union
types.

One of the problems associated with typescript, is that it is very complex with e.g.
conditional types and can be considered turing-complete. The proposed DSL tries to
specifically avoid these pitfalls in the type system.

## JSON

JSON is a data-transfer protocol and the RFC for graph type systems and versioning use it
to express types. The main pain point with JSON is that it is very verbose and hard
to write, read and validate for a human, with a lot of redundant information.

To ease with all the associated problems, this DSL is getting proposed created to ease the
development and modification of types.

## Nix Language

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is an ecosystem to create reproducible builds and deployments,
which has a custom DSL,
the [Nix Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_Nix_Language), which is a
functional configuration language.
This has sparked controversy, and some accredited the DSL as part as to why nix hasn't
found widespread adoption yet, due to the fact that often a functional programming
language isn't very suitable as a configuration language.
This proposal learns from that "mistake" and tries to instead take a more traditional
approach through the use of declarative paradigms instead.

# Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

* Should we do `entity "Entity" = <block>` (consistent with `prop`)
  or `entity "Entity" <block>`?

# Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This DSL and toolbox is specifically designed to be extended by various means, this lists
some possible future extensions, which should be added once other RFCs add new
features to the type system.

### Additional Item Information

Links and properties may have additional information attached to them in the future, this
DSL would provide support through the following extension:

```abnf
item-key-value = id "=" VALUE
item-block = "{" [*(item-key-value ",") item-key-value [","]] "}"
entity-item = entity-item-old [item-block]
```

#### Example 1

```abnf
prop "Title" {
  [a]? {prop1 = 2},
  b
}
```

### Reverse Links

Should reverse links be implemented in the graph type system they can be implemented in
this DSL by reversing the arrows from `->` to `<-` and `~>` to `<~`.

### Data Types

The keyword `data` is reserved for custom `data` types in the future.

### Computed Props

The DSL could in theory support computed properties
through [Additional Item Information](#additional-item-information) and a specific
sub-language which is used to express the computation required.

### Sharing Entity Structures

The alias for entities, links and data are currently reserved and unused; one could
imagine an extension of the language, which makes use of a spread syntax to share common
properties for entities and property objects.

#### Example 1

```
alias entity human = {
  favorite-hobby/1,
  
  ~> friends?
};

entity "Child" = {
  age/1,
  ...human
};

entity "Adult" = {
  occupation/1,
  ...human
};
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance could be done through multiple ways: a new keyword: `extends` or implicitly
through the spread syntax.

#### Example 1

```
entity person "Person" = {
  age/1
};

// proposal (1): allow spread syntax on entities
entity "Child" = {
  ...person,
  grade/1
}

// proposal (2): use a new keyword `extends`
entity "Adult" extends person = {
  occupation/1
}
```

### Default Values

Default values could be defined through an extension of the language, which has been
shown/used in the `use` state. The schema would be extended to allow the following:

```
entity person "Person" = {
  age/1 = 12
}
```

where `= 12` is the default value for that specific property.

This could be enabled for entities, properties, etc.

### Default Entity

Default entity can be created with a new keyword combination: `with default` or through
attributes.

```
// proposal (1): with default
entity "Person" = {
  age/1
} with default {
  age/1 = 12
}

// proposal (2): attribute (preferred)
#[default = {age/1 = 12}]
entity "Person" = {
  age/1
}
```

### Examples

Examples could be through the use of attribute macros or
via [Additional Item Information](#additional-item-information).

For the first approach, we would need to relax the definition and allow them on
properties.

```
// proposal (1): attribute (preferred)
#[example = {age/1 = 13}]
#[example = {age/1 = 14}]
entity person "Person" = {
  #[example = 12]
  age/1
}

// proposal (2): with example
entity person "Person" = {
  age/1 {examples = [12]}
} with example {
  age/1 = 13
} with example {
  age/1 = 14
}
```

### Descriptions of Fields

We relax the grammar to allow doc-comments on properties and entity field.

```
entity person "Person" = {
  /// The age of a person
  age/1
}
```

### Link Keywords

While not fully being in the spec, this is already in the type package.

Keywords can be created with two proposals:

1) attributes (preferred)
2) `with keywords`

```
// proposal (1): attributes
#[keyword = "y"]
#[keyword = "x"]
link "Owned By";

// proposal (2): with keyword
link "Owned By" with keywords ["y", "x"] ;
```

### Plurals

Plurals are currently not in the spec, but already implemented in the type system.

There are two proposals to create them:

1) attributes
2) additional property

```
// proposal (1): attribute
#[plural = "People"]
entity person "Person" = {
  age/1
}

// proposal (2): additional property
entity person "Person" "People" = {
  age/1
}
```
